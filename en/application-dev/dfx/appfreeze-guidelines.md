## Overview

AppFreeze (application freeze) means that an application does not respond to user operations (for example, clicking) for a specified period of time. In this case, the system detects AppFreeze faults and generates AppFreeze logs for fault analysis.

> **NOTE**
>
> This guide applies only to applications in the stage model. Before using this guide, you must have basic knowledge about the JS applications, C++ program stacks, and application-related subsystems.

## Detection Principles

Currently, AppFreeze detection supports the fault types listed in the following table.

> **NOTE**
>
> AppFreeze detection takes effect only for [applications of the release version](performance-analysis-kit-terminology.md#applications-of-the-release-version), but not for [applications of the debug version](performance-analysis-kit-terminology.md#applications-of-the-debug-version)

| Fault| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| THREAD_BLOCK_6S | The application main thread times out.|
| APP_INPUT_BLOCK | The user input response times out.|
| LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT | Ability lifecycle switching times out.|

When any of the preceding faults occurs in an application, the application is killed to ensure that it is recoverable and the application freeze event is reported. You can subscribe to the [application freeze event](hiappevent-watcher-freeze-events.md) by using HiAppEvent.

### THREAD_BLOCK_6S Application Main Thread Timeout

**Description**: This fault indicates that the main thread of this application is suspended or too many tasks are executed, affecting task execution smoothness and experience.

**Detection principle**: The watchdog thread of the application periodically inserts an activation detection to the main thread. If the activity detection is not executed within 3s, the **THREAD_BLOCK_3S** warning event is reported. If the activity detection is not executed within 6s, the **THREAD_BLOCK_6S** main thread timeout event is reported. The two events constitute an AppFreeze log.

The following figure shows the detection principle.

**Figure 1**
![thread_block](figures/thread_block.png)

### APP_INPUT_BLOCK User Input Response Timeout

**Description**: This fault occurs when the tap event is not responded within 5 seconds.

**Detection principle**: When a user taps an application, the input system sends a tap event to the application. If the application response times out, this fault is reported.

The following figure shows the detection principle.

**Figure 2**
![app_input_block](figures/app_input_block.png)

### Lifecycle Switching Timeout

**Description**: Lifecycle switching timeouts include [ability lifecycle](../application-models/uiability-lifecycle.md) switching timeout and [page lifecycle](../application-models/pageability-lifecycle.md) switching timeout.

This fault occurs during lifecycle switching and affects Ability switching and PageAbility switching of the application.

**Detection principle**: The AMS service of foundation sends a lifecycle switching instruction to the application process, and then waits for the application to return the result. If the task is not completed within a specified period of time, a fault is reported.

The lifecycle switching timeout event consists of the **LIFECYCLE_HALF_TIMEOUT** and **LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT** events. **LIFECYCLE_HALF_TIMEOUT** is used as the warning event of **LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT** to capture the binder information.

**Figure 3**

![lifecycle_timeout](figures/lifecycle_timeout.png)

Timeout durations vary with lifecycles. For details, see the following table.

| Lifecycle| Timeout Duration|
| -------- | -------- |
| Load | 10s |
| Foreground | 5s |

## Obtaining Logs

Both application freeze logs and process crash logs are managed by the FaultLogger module and can be obtained using any of the following methods:

**Method 1: DevEco Studio**

DevEco Studio collects process crash logs from **/data/log/faultlog/faultlogger/** to FaultLog, where logs are displayed by process name and fault time. For details about how to obtain logs, see [Fault Log](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/ide-fault-log).

**Method 2: HiAppEvent APIs**

HiAppEvent provides APIs for subscribing to faults. For details, see [Introduction to HiAppEvent](hiappevent-intro.md). Subscribe to the application freeze event by referring to [Subscribing to Application Freeze Events (ArkTS)](hiappevent-watcher-freeze-events-arkts.md) or [Subscribing to Application Freeze Events (C/C++)](hiappevent-watcher-freeze-events-ndk.md), and read the fault log file content based on the [external_log](hiappevent-watcher-crash-events.md#fields) field of the event.

**Method 3: hdc**

Enable the developer option and run the **hdc file recv /data/log/faultlog/faultlogger D:\** command to export fault logs to the local device. The fault log file name is in the format of **appfreeze-process name-process UID-millisecond-level timestamp.log**.

## Log Specifications

You need to analyze AppFreeze problems based on AppFreeze logs and HiLog logs.

The following example is for reference only. You should analyze the problem based on the actual situation.

AppFreeze logs consist of the following information:

Since API version 21, when a system resource alarm is generated (for example, the available memory is less than 500 MB or the shell temperature exceeds 46Â°C), a **NOTE** line is displayed. When this line is displayed, you can ignore the application freeze fault. In earlier API versions, this line is not displayed regardless of the system resource status.

All the three types of AppFreeze events include the following information.

| Field| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| Reason | Reason why the application freezes, corresponding to the application freeze detection capability.|
| PID | PID of the faulty process.|
| PACKAGE_NAME | Application process package name.|
|[Page switch history](./cppcrash-guidelines.md#faults-with-page-switching-history)| Since API version 21, the maintenance and debugging process records the application switching history. After an application fault occurs, the generated fault file contains the page switching history. If the maintenance and debugging service process is faulty or the switching history is not cached, this field is not displayed.|

The following describes the MSG information with two complete lifecycle switchover examples.

(1) Events in the load phase (when the application process is not created)

| | | |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| server | client | Description |
| AbilityRecord::LoadAbility; the LoadAbility lifecycle starts. |- | Start. |
| AppMgrServiceInner::LoadAbility | -| The process is yet to be created. |
| AppMgrService::AttachApplication | -| The process is successfully created and attached. |
| ServiceInner::AttachApplication | -| The process is attached. |
| ServiceInner::LaunchApplication | -| The application is scheduled to execute the loading process. |
| AppRunningRecord::LaunchApplication | -| The application is scheduled to execute the loading process. |
| AppScheduler::ScheduleLaunchApplication | -| The application is scheduled to execute the loading process. |
| -| ScheduleLaunchApplication | The application receives a loading scheduling request. |
| -| HandleLaunchApplication begin | The application loading starts. |
| -| HandleLaunchApplication end | The application loading ends. |
| AppRunningRecord::LaunchPendingAbilities | -| The application is scheduled to start ability. |
| -| MainThread::ScheduleLaunchAbility | The application receives a request to load ability. |
| -| MainThread::HandleLaunchAbility | The main thread processes the request. |
| -| JsAbilityStage::Create | An AbilityStage is loaded. |
| -| JsAbilityStage::OnCreate begin | The **onCreate** lifecycle of AbilityStage starts. |
| -| JsAbilityStage::OnCreate end | The **onCreate** lifecycle of **AbilityStage** ends. |
| -| AbilityThread::Attach | The ability is attached to AMS, and the loading process ends. |

 (2) Foreground phase event â cold start

| | | |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| server | client | Description |
| AbilityRecord::ProcessForegroundAbility; the ProcessForegroundAbility lifecycle starts. |  | Start. |
| ServiceInner::UpdateAbilityState | -| The application frontend is scheduled first. |
| AppRunningRecord::ScheduleForegroundRunning | -| The application foreground is scheduled. |
| AppScheduler::ScheduleForegroundApplication | -| The application foreground is scheduled. |
| -| ScheduleForegroundApplication | The application receives a scheduling request. |
| -| HandleForegroundApplication | The main thread executes the scheduling request. |
| AppMgrService::AppForegrounded | -| The application enters the foreground. |
| ServiceInner::AppForegrounded | -| The application enters the foreground. |
| -| AbilityThread::ScheduleAbilityTransaction | The application receives an ability foreground scheduling request. |
| -| AbilityThread::HandleAbilityTransaction | The main thread executes the ability foreground scheduling. |
| -| JsUIAbility::OnStart begin | The **onCreate** lifecycle starts. |
| -| JsUIAbility::OnStart end | The **onCreate** lifecycle ends. |
| -| JsUIAbility::OnSceneCreated begin | The window scene creation starts. |
| -| JsUIAbility::OnSceneCreated end | The window scene creation ends. |
| -| JsUIAbility::OnWillForeground begin | -|
| -| JsUIAbility::OnWillForeground end |- |
| -| JsUIAbility::WindowScene::GoForeground begin | The window API is called to execute **goForeground**. |
| -| UIAbilityImpl::WindowLifeCycleImpl::AfterForeground | The callback after the window migration. |
| -| JsUIAbility::OnForeground begin | The **onForeground** lifecycle starts. |
| -| JsUIAbility::OnForeground end | The **onForeground** lifecycle ends. |
| -| | The foreground lifecycle ends after both the window callback and **onForeground** are complete. |

You can analyze other log information by referring to [Log Specifications](#log-specifications). Note that the main thread is suspended during lifecycle switching in most cases. You can compare the stack and BinderCatcher information in the two event logs.
