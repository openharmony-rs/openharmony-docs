# Using HiTraceChain (ArkTS)

## Overview

HiTraceChain is a lightweight implementation of the cloud-based distributed call chain tracing on the device side. It allows the calls made in a service process to be traced, helping locate issues across threads, processes, and devices. With hiTraceChain, a unique ID is generated for a service process, passed throughout the service process, and associated with various output information (including application events, system time, and logs). During debugging and fault locating, you can use the unique **chainId** to quickly correlate various information related to the service process. hiTraceChain provides APIs to implement call chain tracing throughout a service process. This can help you quickly obtain the run log for the call chain of a service process and locate faults across devices, processes, and threads.

## Basic Concepts

**chainId**: a distributed trace ID that uniquely identifies a service process being traced. It is a part of **hiTraceId**.

## Available APIs

The APIs for distributed call chain tracing are provided by the **hiTraceChain** module. For details, see [Distributed Tracing](../reference/apis-performance-analysis-kit/js-apis-hitracechain.md).

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------ |
| hiTraceChain.begin(name: string, flags?: number = HiTraceFlag.DEFAULT)   |Starts call chain tracing.  |
| hiTraceChain.end(id: HiTraceId)                                          |Stops call chain tracing.   |

## How to Develop

The following example walks you through on how to implement distributed call chain tracing on  a one-time [application event logging](../reference/apis-performance-analysis-kit/js-apis-hiviewdfx-hiappevent.md).

1. Create an ets application project. In the **entry/src/main/ets/pages/index.ets** file, add a button to trigger system event logging. The sample code is as follows:

    ```ts
    import { BusinessError } from '@kit.BasicServicesKit';
    import { hiAppEvent, hilog, hiTraceChain } from '@kit.PerformanceAnalysisKit';

    @Entry
    @Component
    struct Index {
      @State message: string = 'Start writing an app event';

      build() {
        Row() {
          Column() {
            Button(this.message)
              .fontSize(20)
              .margin(5)
              .width(350)
              .height(60)
              .fontWeight(FontWeight.Bold)
              .onClick(() => {
                try {
                  // Start distributed call chain tracing before the service starts.
                  let traceId = hiTraceChain.begin("Write a new app event", hiTraceChain.HiTraceFlag.INCLUDE_ASYNC);
                  // Log a button onclick event when the button is clicked.
                  let eventParams: Record<string, number> = { 'click_time': 100 }
                  let eventInfo: hiAppEvent.AppEventInfo = {
                    // Define the event domain.
                    domain: "button",
                    // Define the event name.
                    name: "click",
                    // Define the event type.
                    eventType: hiAppEvent.EventType.BEHAVIOR,
                    // Define the event parameters.
                    params: eventParams
                  }
                  hiAppEvent.write(eventInfo).then(() => {
                    hilog.info(0x0000, 'testTag', `Succeeded in writing an app event`);
                    // Stop distributed call chain tracing when the service ends.
                    hiTraceChain.end(traceId)
                  }).catch((err: BusinessError) => {
                    hilog.error(0x0000, 'testTag', `HiAppEvent err.code: ${err.code}, err.message: ${err.message}`);
                  })
                } catch (err) {
                  console.error(`error message is ${(err as BusinessError).message}`);
                }
              })
          }
          .width('100%')
        }
        .height('100%')
      }
    }
    ```

2. In DevEco Studio, click the **Run** button to run the project. Then, click the **Start writing an app event** button on the application UI to trigger system event logging.

3. View the information printed in the **Log** window. <br>You can use **.*\[([0-9a-zA-Z]{15}).*].** to filter log information and view the distributed call chain tracing information specific to the service. <br>The process ID of the HAP service is **21519**. Two threads, whose IDs are **21519** and **23924**, are involved in the system event logging. Based on the chain ID **a92ab94c18e1341**, you can trace the log information of the two threads.

   ```

## Constraints

The distributed call chain tracing across processes or devices depends on whether inter-process or inter-device communication exists in the Node-API implementations of  OpenHarmony modules<!--Del-->. For details, see <!--Del-->[HiTraceChain Development Guide](../../device-dev/subsystems/subsys-dfx-hitracechain.md)<!--DelEnd-->.
