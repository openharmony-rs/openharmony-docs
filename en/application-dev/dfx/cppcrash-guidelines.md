## Overview

After a process crashes, the system detects the crash, captures crash information, generates crash logs, and reports crash events, providing detailed maintenance and debugging logs for you to locate faults. This topic describes the CppCrash detection methods provided by the system in terms of basic concepts, implementation principles, restrictions, log obtaining, and log specifications.  

## Basic Concepts

- **Signal**

  A mechanism for inter-process communication in POSIX-compliant operating systems. It provides asynchronous notifications that interrupt the target process's normal control flow.

- **Signal handler**

  Contains functions executed by a process after it receives a particular signal. It must be registered for the specific signals it is intended to handle.

- **pc**

  Program Counter (PC) stores the address of the instruction that is being executed by the program.

- **Call stack**

  Records the sequence of function calls for each thread, from its start up to the current point (such as the crash site).

- **Register**

  High-speed storage unit in the CPU, which are used to store data, instruction addresses, or status information required during the execution of computer programs. In this topic, register information refers to the data, instruction addresses, or status information stored in the register when a crash occurs.

## Implementation Principles

The system detects a process crash as follows:

- After a process crashes, it receives a crash signal from the kernel, which is processed by the signal handling module registered by the process during startup.

- After receiving the crash signal, the process saves the current process context and forks a child process to execute the **ProcessDump** command to capture crash information.

3. The **ProcessDump** process writes the crash log data to a temporary directory for storage.

4. After collecting crash logs, the **ProcessDump** process reports the logs to the HiView process, supplements some information (such as the system memory status and application page switching history) that can be obtained only by HiView, stores the crash logs in the **/data/log/faultlog/faultlogger** directory, and generates a fault event.

### Crash Signals

Based on the POSIX signal mechanism, the system's process crash detection capability supports the following crash signals.

| Signo| Signal| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 4 | SIGILL | Invalid instruction| An invalid, incorrectly formatted, unknown, or privileged instruction is executed.|
| 5 | SIGTRAP | Breakpoint or trap| An exception occurs or a trap instruction is executed.|
| 6 | SIGABRT | Process abort| The process is aborted abnormally. Generally, this exception occurs when the process calls **abort()** in the Standard Function Library.|
| 7 | SIGBUS | Illegal memory access| The process accesses an unaligned or nonexistent physical address.|
| 8 | SIGFPE | Floating-point exception| An incorrect arithmetic operation is executed, for example, a 0 divisor, floating point overflow, or integer overflow.|
| 11 | SIGSEGV | Invalid memory access| The process accesses an invalid memory region.|
| 16 | SIGSTKFLT | Stack error| The processor performs an incorrect stack operation, such as a pop when the stack is empty or a push when the stack is full.|
| 31 | SIGSYS | Incorrect system call| An incorrect or invalid parameter is used in a system call.|

Crash signals are classified by error code (**code**) as follows:

### SIGILL

**SIGILL** indicates an invalid instruction exception in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The trigger causes of **SIGILL** are as follows.

| Error Code (**code**)| Value| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | ILL_ILLOPC | Illegal operation code| An instruction not supported by the CPU or an invalid instruction is executed.|
| 2 | ILL_ILLOPN | Illegal operand| An incorrect operand or improper operand type is used.|
| 3 | ILL_ILLADR | Illegal address| The program accesses an invalid memory address or an unaligned memory address.|
| 4 | ILL_ILLTRP | Illegal trap| The program performs an illegal trap instruction or an undefined operation.|
| 5 | ILL_PRVOPC | Illegal privileged operation code| A common user executes a privileged instruction.|
| 6 | ILL_PRVREG | Illegal privileged register|  A common user accesses a privileged register.|
| 7 | ILL_COPROC | Illegal coprocessor| The program performs an undefined coprocessor instruction.|
| 8 | ILL_BADSTK | Illegal stack| The program performs an operation at an invalid stack address, or when the stack overflows.|
| 0xacac | ILL_ILLPACCFI | Illegal pointer authentication| The program fails to verify a pointer.|

### SIGTRAP

**SIGTRAP** usually occurs in debugging and tracking. The trigger causes of **SIGTRAP** are as follows.

| Error Code (**code**)| Value| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | TRAP_BRKPT | Software breakpoint| The program reaches the software breakpoint. When debugging a program, a software breakpoint at the key position can be used to pause the program execution and check information such as variable values.|
| 2 | TRAP_TRACE | Single-step debugging| The program executes a single instruction. Single instruction can be used to check the execution result of each instruction.|
| 3 | TRAP_BRANCH | Branch tracing| The program executes a branch instruction. Branch instruction can be used to control the execution process of a program, such as if statements and loop statements.|
| 4 | TRAP_HWBKPT | Hardware breakpoint| The program reaches the hardware breakpoint. When debugging a program, a hardware breakpoint at the key position can be used to pause the program execution and check information such as variable values. Unlike a software breakpoint, a hardware breakpoint is implemented in CPU hardware. Therefore, whether a hardware breakpoint is triggered can be detected in real time during program execution.|

### SIGBUS

The **SIGBUS** signal is sent by the operating system to a process. It usually indicates a memory access error. The trigger causes of **SIGBUS** are as follows.

| Error Code (**code**)| Value| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | BUS_ADRALN | Unaligned memory address| The program accesses an unaligned memory address, for example, a non-even address of a 4-byte integer.|
| 2 | BUS_ADRERR | Invalid memory address| The program accesses a memory address that does not exist in the process address space, such as a null pointer.|
| 3 | BUS_OBJERR | Invalid object access| The program accesses a deleted or uninitialized object.|
| 4 | BUS_MCEERR_AR | Hardware memory error requiring immediate handling| The program accesses memory and encountered a hardware memory error requiring immediate handling.|
| 5 | BUS_MCEERR_AO | Hardware memory error requiring waiting or delayed handling| The program accesses memory and encountered a hardware memory error requiring waiting or delayed handling.|

### SIGFPE

The **SIGFPE** signal indicates a floating-point exception or an arithmetic exception. The trigger causes of **SIGFPE** are as follows.

| Error Code (**code**)| Value| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | FPE_INTDIV | Invalid integer division|  The program performs an integer division operation while the divisor is zero.|
| 2 | FPE_INTOVF | Integer overflow|  The program performs an integer operation and the result exceeds the integer range.|
| 3 | FPE_FLTDIV | Invalid floating-point division|  The program performs a floating-point division operation while the divisor is zero.|
| 4 | FPE_FLTOVF | Floating-point overflow|  The program performs a floating-point operation and the result exceeds the upper limit of the floating-point number.|
| 5 | FPE_FLTUND | Floating-point underflow|  The program performs a floating-point operation and the result is less than the lower limit of the floating-point number.|
| 6 | FPE_FLTRES | Invalid floating-point result|  The program performs a floating-point operation and the result is undefined.|
| 7 | FPE_FLTINV | Invalid floating-point operation|  The program performs an invalid floating-point operation.|
| 8 | FPE_FLTSUB | Invalid floating-point operation result|  The program attempts to perform a floating-point operation and the floating-point result is out of range.|

### SIGSEGV

**SIGSEGV** occurs when a process accesses a non-existent memory address or an inaccessible address. The trigger causes of the **SIGSEGV** signal are described as follows:

| Error Code (**code**)| Value| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | SEGV_MAPERR | Non-existent memory address| The process accesses a memory address that does not exist or that is not mapped to the process address space. This exception is usually caused by pointer errors or memory leaks.|
| 2 | SEGV_ACCERR | Inaccessible memory address| The process accesses an inaccessible memory address marked by the operating system, for example, writing data to read-only memory or executing memory without execution permission. This exception is usually caused by buffer overflow or modifying read-only memory.|

### Signal Causes

In addition to the preceding classification by **signo**, signals can also be classified by causes as follows.

| Error Code (**code**)| Value| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0 | SI_USER | User space signal| Sent from a process in user space to another process, usually using **kill()**. For example, when a user presses **Ctrl+C** on the terminal, a **SIGINT** signal is sent to all foreground processes.|
| 0x80 | SI_KERNEL | Kernel signal| Sent from the kernel to a process when the kernel detects an error or exception. For example, when a process accesses an invalid memory address or executes an invalid instruction, the kernel sends a **SIGSEGV** signal to the process.|
| -1 | SI_QUEUE | **sigqueue()** signal| Sent from **sigqueue()**, with an additional integer value and a pointer can be carried. It is usually used for advanced communication between processes, such as transferring data or notifying a process that an event occurs.|
| -2 | SI_TIMER | Timer signal| Sent from a timer for executing scheduled tasks or periodic tasks. For example, when a timer expires, the kernel sends a **SIGALRM** signal to the process.|
| -3 | SI_MESGQ | Message queue signal| Sent from a message queue for inter-process communication. For example, when a process sends a message to a message queue, the kernel sends a **MESGQ** signal to the receiving process.|
| -4 | SI_ASYNCIO | Asynchronous I/O signal| Sent from an asynchronous I/O operation for non-blocking I/O operations. For example, when an I/O operation on a file descriptor is complete, the kernel sends an **ASYNCIO** signal to the process.|
| -5 | SI_SIGIO | Synchronous I/O signal| Sent from a synchronous I/O operation for blocking I/O operations. For example, when an I/O operation on a file descriptor is complete, the kernel sends a **SIGIO** signal to the process.|
| -6 | SI_TKILL | **tkill()** signal| Sent from the function **tkill()**, which is similar to the function **kill()**. Moreover, you can specify the ID of the thread that sends the signal using **tkill()**. It is usually used to send a signal to a specified thread in a multithreaded program.|

## Restrictions

- It is not recommended that the process register the signal handler; otherwise, if the process exit is delayed beyond 5s, the process freeze event may be reported.

- The **/data/log/faultlog/faultlogger** directory stores a maximum of 10 CppCrash logs for a process or application. If the upper limit is reached, the earliest CppCrash logs of the process or application will be deleted. It is recommended that you view the CppCrash logs in a timely manner during development and debugging to prevent crash information loss due to log deletion.

- The system has registered signal handlers for the preceding crash signals and signals **35**, **38**, and **42**. It is recommended that you do not register signal handlers for these signals in applications. Otherwise, the system detection capability may fail.

- The asynchronous thread stack tracing and maintenance functionality is enabled only in the ARM 64-bit system in debug mode. For details about the crash log specifications, see [Asynchronous Thread Stack Tracing Faults](#asynchronous-thread-stack-tracing-faults).

## Obtaining Logs

Process crash logs are a type of fault logs. You can obtain them in any of the following ways:

**Method 1: DevEco Studio**

DevEco Studio collects process crash logs from **/data/log/faultlog/faultlogger/** to FaultLog, where logs are displayed by process name and fault type. For details about how to obtain logs, see [DevEco Studio User Guide-Fault Log](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/ide-fault-log).

**Method 2: HiAppEvent APIs**

HiAppEvent provides APIs for subscribing to faults. For details, see [Introduction to HiAppEvent](hiappevent-intro.md). You can subscribe to the crash event by referring to [Subscribing to Crash Events (ArkTS)](hiappevent-watcher-crash-events-arkts.md) or [Subscribing to Crash Events (C/C++)](hiappevent-watcher-crash-events-ndk.md), and read the fault log file content based on the [external_log](hiappevent-watcher-crash-events.md#fields) field of the event.

**Method 3: hdc**

Enable **Developer options** and run the hdc file recv /data/log/faultlog/faultlogger D:\ command to export fault logs to the local device. The fault log file name is in the format of **cppcrash-process name-process UID-millisecond-level timestamp.log**.

Trace ID provided by HiTraceChain. For details, see [HiTraceId](../reference/apis-performance-analysis-kit/capi-trace-h.md).

**Call stack frame**

The following describes the content of a three-layer call stack in detail:

```text
#00 pc 000e8400 /system/lib/ld-musl-arm.so.1(raise+176)(a40044d0acb68107cfc4adb5049c0725)

```

| Frame| Number of Offset Bytes of PC in the File| File Name of the Memory Segment to Which PC Belongs| Function| Number of Offset Bytes in the Function| BuildID |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| \#00 | 000e8400 | /system/lib/ld-musl-arm.so.1 | raise | 176 | a40044d0acb68107cfc4adb5049c0725 |

> **NOTE**
>
> - The file name may also be an anonymous memory mapping, for example, **[heap]** or **[stack]**.
>
> - The possible causes for the failure to print function names in logs are as follows:
>   - The function name is not saved in the binary file.
>
>   - The length of the function name saved in the binary file exceeds 256 bytes.
>
> - If **BuildID** is not printed, you can run the **readelf -n xxx.so** command to check whether the binary file has **BuildID**. If not, add the compilation parameter **--enable-linker-build-id** to the compilation options. Do not add **--build-id=none**.

**JS hybrid stack frame**

The 64-bit ARM system can capture cross-language call stacks between C++ and JS. Therefore, if the function call chain contains JS code, the crash log also records the JS call stack in the following format:

```text
#00 at onPageShow (entry|har1|1.0.0|src/main/ets/pages/Index.ts:7:13)
```

For details, see [Exception Code Call Stack Formats](jscrash-guidelines.md#exception-code-call-stack-formats).

### Null Pointer Dereference

Null pointer dereference often  occurs in the following scenarios:

1. When a crash is in format of **SIGSEGV(SEGV_MAPERR)\@0x00000000** or the values of the registers such as **r0** and **r1** in the **Register** field are **0**, a null pointer may be passed in when the function is called.

2. When a crash is in format of **SIGSEGV(SEGV_MAPERR)\@0x0000000c** (smaller than the size of a memory page) or the value of the registers such as **r1** in the **Register** field is small, a null pointer may be passed in when the struct member of the input parameter is called.

In this scenario, a message is printed in the log, indicating that the fault may be caused by a null pointer dereference. The following is an example process crash log archived by DevEco Studio in FaultLog:

### Stack Overflow

Stack overflow may occur in the following scenarios:

- The stack memory is used up because the recursive termination condition is not set during recursive call.

- The stack memory is used up because local variables occupy too much stack memory.

- The stack memory used in the signal stack exceeds the system limit.

The following example shows that the stack memory is used up because the recursive termination condition is not set during recursive call.

```c++
static void *DoStackOverflow(void * inputArg) __attribute__((optnone))
{
    int b[10] = {1};
    if (b[0] == 0) {
        return static_cast<void*>(b + 9); // 9: last element of array
    }
    DoStackOverflow(inputArg); // Recursive calls are made multiple times. As a result, the stack memory is used up, and memory is read and written outside the stack, causing a crash.
    return static_cast<void*>(b + 9); // 9: last element of array
}
```

In this scenario, a message is recorded in the log, indicating that the fault may be caused by stack overflow. The following is an example process crash log archived by DevEco Studio in FaultLog:

### Stack Corruptions

Stack corruptions occur when the stack memory that stores function call information is overwritten during service code running. As a result, the call stack cannot be traced. In this scenario, the system displays a message in the log, indicating that you need to parse the unreliable call stack in the thread stack memory from **\#xx**. The call stack is unreliable because it may not be a complete function call chain. From level **\#xx** downward, adjacent frames do not necessarily reflect a true call relationship. You must deduce the actual sequence from the service source. In the following example, the correct call relationship is **\#05** -> **\#04** -> **\#03** -> **\#01**. The following is an example process crash log archived by DevEco Studio in FaultLog:

### Asynchronous Thread Stack Tracing Faults

When an asynchronous thread crashes, the stack of the thread that submits the asynchronous task is also printed to locate the fault. The call stack of the crash thread and that of the submission thread are separated by **SubmitterStacktrace**. The following is an example process crash log archived by DevEco Studio in FaultLog:

> **NOTE**
>
> The asynchronous thread stack tracing functionality is enabled only for debug-type applications in the ARM 64-bit system.

### Application Crash Log Configured by HiAppEvent

The system provides a common crash log generation functionality. To meet personalized requirements of some applications on the crash log content, HiAppEvent provides the [setEventConfig](hiappevent-watcher-crash-events.md#customizing-crash-log-specifications) API to set crash log configuration parameters. The following is the core content of a 32-bit system crash log archived by DevEco Studio in FaultLog:

### Faults with Page Switching History

Since API version 21, the maintenance and debugging process records the application switching history for applications that involve page switching. After an application fault occurs, the generated fault file contains the page switching history.

A maximum of 10 latest history records can be recorded in a fault log file.

```text
...
Foreground:Yes
Page switch history:
  14:08:30:327 /ets/pages/Index:JsError
  14:08:28:986 /ets/pages/Index
  14:08:07:606 :leaves foreground
  14:08:06:246 /ets/pages/Index:AppFreeze
  14:08:01:955 :enters foreground
Timestamp:2025-08-20 14:08:30:327
Pid:10208
Uid:0
...
```

The format of a record is as follows:
```text
  14:08:30:327 /ets/pages/Index:JsError
       ^             ^            ^
    Switching time   Page URL   Page name
```

> **NOTE**
>
> The child page's name is available only when it is navigated to through **Navigation**. The page name is defined in the [system routing table](../ui/arkts-navigation-navigation.md#system-routing-table).
>
> When the application switches between the foreground and background, the corresponding page URL is empty, but **enters foreground** and **leaves foreground** are displayed as special page names.
