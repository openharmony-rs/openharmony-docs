# Analyzing C++ Crash

A process crash refers to an unexpected exit of an application or a system process. It occurs in the following scenarios:

- The native code does not process [C++ crash signals](#c-crash-signals) and C++ crash logs are generated.
- The JS/ArkTS code does process exceptions and JS crash logs are generated. For details, see [Analyzing JS Crash](jscrash-guidelines.md).
3. The application is suspended, AppFreeze logs are generated, and the application is killed and exits. For details, see [Analyzing Application Freeze](appfreeze-guidelines.md).
4. The process exits unexpectedly due to other mechanisms of the system.

This topic describes how to use the detailed system logs to analyze, locate, and rectify C++ crashes. The main contents are as follows:

- [Analysis procedure](#analysis-procedure) for C++ crash faults, including obtaining logs, analyzing faults, and verifying whether faults are rectified.
- [Case Analysis](#case-analysis) of how to locate, analyze, and rectify common crash faults.
- Some detailed information about how to locate faults in [Appendix](#appendix).

## Analysis Procedure

### Obtaining Crash Logs

C++ crash logs are managed together with application freeze and JS crash logs by the FaultLogger module. You can obtain C++ crash logs using any of the following methods:

#### Method 1: DevEco Studio

DevEco Studio collects process crash logs from **/data/log/faultlog/faultlogger/** to FaultLog, where logs are displayed by process name, fault, and time. For details about how to obtain logs, see [Fault Log](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/ide-fault-log).

#### Method 2: HiAppEvent APIs

HiAppEvent provides APIs for subscribing to faults. For details, see [Introduction to HiAppEvent](hiappevent-intro.md). You can subscribe to the crash event by referring to [Subscribing to Crash Events (ArkTS)](hiappevent-watcher-crash-events-arkts.md) or [Subscribing to Crash Events (C/C++)](hiappevent-watcher-crash-events-ndk.md), and read the crash log based on the [external_log](hiappevent-watcher-crash-events.md#params) field of the event.

#### Method 3: hdc

Enable the developer option and run the **hdc file recv /data/log/faultlog/faultlogger D:\** command to export fault logs to the local device. The fault log file name is in the format of **cppcrash-process name-process UID-millisecond-level timestamp.log**.

<!--Del-->
#### Method 4: Shell

(1) When a process crashes, you can find fault logs in **/data/log/faultlog/temp/** on the device. The log file is named in the format of **cppcrash-process PID-millisecond-level timestamp**. They contain information such as the process crash call stack, process crash register, stack memory, maps, and process file handle list.

![cppcrash-temp-log](figures/20230407111853.png)

(2) You can find more comprehensive fault logs in **/data/log/faultlog/faultlogger/**, which include information such as device name, system version and process logs. The log files are named in the format of **cppcrash-process name-process UID-time (millisecond).log**.

![cppcrash-faultlogger-log](figures/cppcrash_image_023.png)
<!--DelEnd-->

### Analyzing C++ Crash Logs

The following describes how to view C++ crash logs and analyze faults. For details about crash logs, see [Crash Logs](#crash-logs).

#### Determining Crash Type Based on Signal

The following describes only the crash types corresponding to common signals. For details about other signals, see [C++ Crash Signals](#c-crash-signals).

```text
Reason:Signal:SIGSEGV(SI_TKILL)@0x000027e0 from:10208:0
Description:
Reason:Signal:signal value(tkill() function signal)@crash address from:PID of the signal:UID of the signal
```

Common crash signals:

- **SIGSEGV**, **SIGILL**, and **SIGBUS**. Crashes corresponding to these signals need to be analyzed based on the register. For case analysis, see [Case 3: Memory Access Crashes](#case-3-memory-access-crash).
- **SIGABRT**, which indicates that the process automatically aborts. To analyze this fault, you need to check the code that calls **abort()** in the call stack. For case analysis, see [Case 5: SIGABRT Crashes](#case-5-sigabrt-crash).

#### Checking Crash Addresses

The **Signal** field in the C++ crash logs carries the address accessed when the process crashes. For example, if an invalid address is accessed, **SIGSEGV** is triggered; if a valid address is accessed but the address does not point to a code segment, **SIGILL** is triggered. In the preceding example, **000027e0** is being accessed when the process crashes.

#### Checking Register and Stack Address Ranges

```text
Registers:  <- Fault registers
r0:00000000 r1:ffc09854 r2:00000000 r3:00000008
r4:00000000 r5:fffff000 r6:0000000a r7:000000af
r8:ffc09919 r9:ffc09930 r10:00000000
fp:ffc098e8 ip:005b76e4 sp:ffbe8daa lr:005ade99 pc:f7bb0400
...
Maps:
...
ffbe9000-ffc0a000 rw-p 00000000 [stack] <- Stack address range. sp is smaller than the low address ffbe9000 of the stack.
```

Check the address stored in the stack pointer (sp). If the address is out of the stack address range or close to the low address of the stack, stack overflow may occur. For most stack overflow problems, C++ crash logs also provide prompt information, which can be used as a reference. For details, see [Stack Overflows](#stack-overflows).

#### Locating the Problematic Code Based on the Crash Stack

Method 1: DevEco Studio

In application development, you can use DevEco Studio to locate the problematic code of the dynamic library in the C++ crash stack. Both native stack frames and JS stack frames are supported. For some stack frames that fail to be parsed and located in DevEco Studio, refer to Method 2.

![cppcrash-addr2line1](figures/cppcrash_image_002.png)

Method 2: SDK llvm-addr2line

 
(1) Obtain the .so file with symbols in the crash stack. Ensure that the file version is the same as that of the running application or system. 
Compiled and built in DevEco Studio, the .so file of dynamic library is generated with symbols by default in **/build/default/intermediates/libs**. You can run the Linux **file** command to check whether the **BuildID** of two .so files match. Generated by the compiler, **BuildID** uniquely identifies a binary file, and **not stripped** indicates that a symbol table is included.

```text
$ file libbabel.so
libbabel.so: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, BuildID[sha1]=fdb1b5432b9ea4e2a3d29780c3abf30e2a22da9d, with debug_info, not stripped
```

In the preceding example, the **BuildID** of the **libbabel.so.** file is **fdb1b5432b9ea4e2a3d29780c3abf30e2a22da9d**. Check whether it is the same as that in the C++ crash logs.

```text
#00     pc 000072e6       /system/lib/libbabel.so(xxxxxxx(void*)+30)(fdb1b5432b9ea4e2a3d29780c3abf30e2a22da9d)
#No.   pc pc offset in the segment   Name of the segment to which the pc belongs(Function name + Number of offset bytes in the function)(BuidldID)
```

> **pc**: Program Counter, which indicates the address of the instruction being executed by the program.

The preceding information shows that the two **libbabel.so** files match. Then, you can proceed with the following analysis process.

(2) Locate the line number of the problematic code using llvm-addr2line.
You can obtain llvm-addr2line from **[SDK DIR PATH]/default/openharmony/native/llvm/bin**, or you need to search for the path as it varies based on the SDK version. 
The following is an example of a core call stack:

```text
# 00 pc 00003510 /data/storage/el1/bundle/libs/arm/libentry.so(TriggerCrash(napi_env__*, napi_callback_info__*)+24)(446ff75d3f6a518172cc52e8f8055650b02b0e54)
# 01 pc 0002b0c5 /system/lib/platformsdk/libace_napi.z.so(panda::JSValueRef ArkNativeFunctionCallBack<true>(panda::JsiRuntimeCallInfo*)+448)(a84fbb767fd826946623779c608395bf)
# 02 pc 001e7597 /system/lib/platformsdk/libark_jsruntime.so(panda::ecmascript::EcmaInterpreter::RunInternal(panda::ecmascript::JSThread*, unsigned char const*, unsigned long long*)+14710)(106c552f6ce4420b9feac95e8b21b792)
# 03 pc 001e0439 /system/lib/platformsdk/libark_jsruntime.so(panda::ecmascript::EcmaInterpreter::Execute(panda::ecmascript::EcmaRuntimeCallInfo*)+984)(106c552f6ce4420b9feac95e8b21b792)
...
# 39 pc 00072998 /system/lib/ld-musl-arm.so.1(libc_start_main_stage2+56)(5b1e036c4f1369ecfdbb7a96aec31155)
# 40 pc 00005b48 /system/bin/appspawn(_start_c+84)(cb0631260fa74df0bc9b0323e30ca03d)
# 41 pc 00005aec /system/bin/appspawn(cb0631260fa74df0bc9b0323e30ca03d)
```

Parsed by SDK llvm-addr2line, the line number of problematic code is as follows:

```text
[SDK DIR PATH]\OpenHarmony\11\native\llvm\bin> .\llvm-addr2line.exe -Cfie libentry.so 3150
TrggerCrash(napi_env__*, napi_callback_info__*)
D:/code/apprecovery-demo/entry/src/main/cpp/hello.cpp:48
```

You can run the **llvm-addr2line.exe -fCpie libutils.z.so pc offset in the segment** command to parse an offset or the **llvm-addr2line.exe -fCpie libxxx.so 0x1bc868 0x1be28c** command to parse multiple offsets. If the line number obtained through llvm-addr2line is incorrect based on the source code analysis, you can slightly adjust the address (for example, subtract 1 from the address) or disable some compilation optimization.

Method 3: hstack of DevEco Studio

hstack is a tool provided by DevEco Studio for you to restore the obfuscated crash stack of a release application to the source code stack. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. For details, see [hstack](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/ide-command-line-hstack).

### Reviewing Code Based on Services

After analyzing the C++ crash logs and locating the line number, check the context in the code and find out the service logic that causes the crash. Based on the crash logs provided by HiLog, analyze the service scenario and find out the suspicious codes. As shown in the following figure, line 48 in the **hello.cpp** file indicates a null pointer dereference.

![cppcrash-demo1](figures/cppcrash_image_004.png)

This example is constructed, and actual scenario is usually more complicate and needs to be analyzed based on services.

### Disassembling (Optional)

If you are familiar with the service process and want to solve a simple problem where the crash occurs, you can locate the problem by analyzing the service code. However, in some complex scenarios, for example, when the method called in a line has multiple parameters, the problem cannot be directly analyzed based on the code. In this case, you need to analyze the problem by disassembling the code. For details, see [Reading Assembly Instructions](#reading-assembly-instructions).

### Analyzing Memory Corruption (Optional)

Memory corruption indicates that the service code uses a valid wild pointer (a pointer to a random memory area) during execution and changes the memory it points to into an invalid value. As a result, the original data stored in the memory is changed, and a crash event occurs when the data is accessed again.

In this case, a random crash call stack is generated and it is difficult to locate the root cause.

To analyze a memory corruption problem, perform the following steps:

#### Locating the Scenario Where the Problem Occurs

Based on the crash logs provided by HiLog, analyze the problem scenario. For example, a problem occurs when a user switches from page 1 to page 2 of an application.

After finding out the scenario, you can determine the codes used in the process and perform tests accordingly. Prioritize the locating of problem scenarios, which is critical to reproducing and analyzing the problem and verifying whether it is fixed.

#### Analyzing Memory Features and Checking Whether It Is Rewritten

The system memory allocator is based on thread affinity, that is, the memory released in a thread is preferentially allocated to the next applicant of the current thread. Therefore, if most faults occur in the same thread, the service that causes memory corruption is related to the crash thread. In this way, you can narrow down the troubleshooting scope.

When the memory accessed by a process is written to, the possible situations are as follows:

- The information is written by the service that illegally accesses the memory. You can find the module where the service is located based on the information.
- The memory is released by the service that illegally accesses it, but another service writes information to the memory. Therefore, the service that illegally accesses the memory cannot be found directly.

Common analysis steps:

- Based on the service code, obtain the corrupted memory and its size by [reading assembly instructions](#reading-assembly-instructions).
- Based on **MemoryNearRegister** in the C++ crash logs, obtain the features of the corrupted memory.
- If the memory features are obvious, for example, the memory contains ASCII code values of strings (continuous values ranging from **0x20** to **0x7e**) or other regular values, the service that causes memory corruption may be quickly located. If no such features exist, continue the analysis.

#### Deploying the Test Environment and Using HWASan to Analyze Problems

(1) Reproduce the problem, and enable [HWASan for detecting memory errors](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/ide-hwasan) to find the site where the service that changes the memory to an invalid value. This is critical for problem analysis.

(2) Deploy the test environment based on the scenario where the problem occurs and evaluate the pressure test duration based on the probability of the problem.

If the problem does not recur for a long time, the test scenario is incorrect. In this case, you need to analyze the efficient scenario based on the onsite logs such as HiLog logs.

(3) Analyze whether there are external modules that may cause the problem.

For example, when a memory corruption problem occurs during video playback, the HiLog information shows that external modules always report poor Wi-Fi signals during the period when the problem occurs. Therefore, it is suspected that the memory corruption problem is related to network delay. After the test environment is set up and the problem is reproduced, the assumption is verified.

(4) Narrow down the scope of the faulty module by excluding unrelated functionalities.

Specifically, disable the functionality one by one until the problem cannot be reproduced. In this way, the problem can be located.
This step requires you to be familiar with the modules and may be costly. Therefore, you can use the binary search to locate the bottleneck.

### Checking Whether the Problem Is Rectified

After the problem is rectified based on the analysis conclusion, deploy the test environment to simulate the scenario where the problem occurs. Evaluate the test duration based on the problem occurrence probability. If the problem does not recur within the test duration, the fault is considered rectified. Otherwise, continue to check other suspicious codes. Note that the fault is only considered rectified if the problem does not recur within the test duration.

## Case Analysis

### Case 1: Null Pointer Dereference

**Background**

Smart pointers are used without null checks, causing null pointer dereference crashes during process execution. 

**Impact**

The process crashes and cannot run stably, resulting in an unexpected exit.

**Fault Analysis**

![cppcrash-demo10](figures/cppcrash_image_017.png)

Null pointer crashes can be identified based on the fault cause. Run the llvm-addr2line command to parse the line number. It is found that the service code does not check whether the smart pointer is null before using it. As a result, the service code accesses the null address, causing the crash.

**Solution**

Add protective null checks for the pointer. 

**Suggestions**

Pointers should be null-checked before using it to prevent null pointers and process crashes and exits.

### Case 2: Multi-thread Competition

**Background**

**napi_env** is still used after being released.

**Symptom**
The key crash stack is as follows.

![cppcrash-demo8](figures/cppcrash_image_014.png)

The **env** (in JavaScript environment) of the Node-API points to an invalid memory, and the crash stack is mounted to **NativeEngineInterface::ClearLastError()**. By using profiling loggings and analyzing service processes before the crash event based on HiLog logs, the address of the **env** is located and it is found that the **env** is still used after being released.

![cppcrash-demo9](figures/cppcrash_image_015.png)

JavaScript is executed by a single thread. Therefore, any operation on **env** must be performed on the original thread that creates the JavaScript thread. Otherwise, unexpected problems may occur.

**Solutions**

Do not transfer the **env** created by a thread to other threads.

**Suggestions**

If the stack top often crashes when **env** operations are performed in libraries such as **libace_napi.z.so** and **libark_jsruntime.so**, and the crash cause cannot be directly analyzed based on the call stack of the C ++ crash logs, you can enable [multi-thread check](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/ide-multi-thread-check) to quickly locate the fault. In addition, when the STL container (such as **vector**, **map**, and **set**) is added or deleted by multiple threads, the **SIGSEGV** fault is likely to occur because the STL container is not thread-safe. Therefore, in scenarios where multiple threads perform operations on the STL container, the fault may be caused by multi-thread competition.

### Case 3: Memory Access Crash

**Background**

The crash address is in the readable and executable segment of **libace_napi_ark.z.so**. The cause is that the address needs to be written, but the corresponding **maps** segment has only the read and execute permissions. In other words, when a process attempts to access a memory area that is not allowed to be accessed, the process crashes.

```text
7f82740000-7f8275c000 r--p 00000000 /system/lib64/libace_napi_ark.z.so
7f8275c000-7f8276e000 r-xp 0001b000 /system/lib64/libace_napi_ark.z.so <- The crash address locates within this address range.
7f8276e000-7f82773000 r--p 0002c000 /system/lib64/libace_napi_ark.z.so
7f82773000-7f82774000 rw-p 00030000 /system/lib64/libace_napi_ark.z.so
```

The following figure shows the crash call stack.

![cppcrash-demo6](figures/cppcrash_image_010.png)

**Fault Analysis**

According to the service logic, the node should be stored in the heap and its address cannot be in the code segment of **libace_napi_ark.z.so**. Therefore, there is a high probability that the problem is caused by memory corruption. In this case, you can use [HWASan](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/ide-hwasan) to locate the memory corruption problem. To find the regular crash scenario, you can use ASan to reproduce the problem. The result shows that the fault detected by ASan is the same as that in the crash stack. The ASan log shows that the memory corruption type is **heap-use-after-free**. Based on the log information, find out the process from memory application, memory release, to use of the released memory. After analysis, it can be determined that the service code repeatedly releases the same address (**0x003a375eb724**) and uses this address to access object members. As a result, the **use-after-free** issue is reported.
The core ASan logs are as follows:

The call stack shows that when **JsiWeak** is destructed or reset, **CopyableGlobal** in the parent class **JsiType** of its member (**JsiObject**/**JsiValue**/**JsiFunction**) is released, as shown in the following figure.

![cppcrash-demo5](figures/cppcrash_image_011.png)

During Garbage Collection (GC), **IterateWeakEcmaGlobalStorage** calls **DisposeGlobalHandle** to release **WeakNode**s without callbacks, as shown in the following figure.

![cppcrash-demo6](figures/cppcrash_image_012.png)

Therefore, for the same **WeakNode**, there may be two ways for release. Since no callback is sent to **JsiWeak** for clearing the released **WeakNode**, **JsiWeak** still stores a reference to the released **WeakNode**, that is, **CopyableGlobal**. In this case, when the **NodeList** containing the **WeakNode** is released and the **CopyableGlobal** reserved in **JsiWeak** is released, the memory is repeatedly released.

![cppcrash-demo7](figures/cppcrash_image_013.png)

**Solutions**

Set a callback for **JsiWeak** using **SetWeakCallback**. Therefore, the callback can notify **JsiWeak** to reset **CopyableGlobal** when **IterateWeakEcmaGlobalStorage** releases the **WeakNode**, ensuring the same address is not repeatedly released.

**Suggestions**

When using memory, consider whether the memory is repeatedly released or not released. Additionally, when locating memory access crashes (usually **SIGSEGV** crashes), use HWASan to reproduce the fault if there is no clue based on the call stack analysis.

### Case 4: Lifecycle Issue

Lifecycle issues occur when the memory of an object is accessed beyond its lifecycle. Generally, lifecycle issues are caused by improper use of raw pointers. A raw pointer does not have encapsulation or automatic memory management features. It is a simple pointer that points to a memory address without protecting or managing the memory. A raw pointer can directly access the memory, but it may cause memory leaks and null pointer references. To avoid potential security problems, use raw pointers with caution. You are advised to use smart pointers to manage memory.

**Background**

When you create a native **napi_value**, it needs to be used with **napi_handle_scope**. The **napi_handle_scope** is used to manage the lifecycle of **napi_value**. **napi_value** can be used only within **napi_handle_scope**, otherwise, the lifecycle of **napi_value** and its JS objects is no longer protected. If the reference count is 0, **napi_value** is collected by GC. Using **napi_value** at this point indicates accessing freed memory, which results in faults. 

**Symptom**

**napi_value** is a raw pointer (a struct pointer). It is used to hold JS objects and maintain the lifecycle of JS objects to ensure that JS objects are not collected by GC. When **napi_value** is used outside **napi_handle_scope**, **napi_value** is collected by GC, and it does not hold the JS object (the lifecycle of the JS object is not protected).

**Fault Analysis**

Based on the call stack, locate the upper-layer API of the faulty Node-API, find the problematic **napi_value**, and check whether it is used outside **napi_handle_scope**.

**Cases**

**napi_value** is used outside **napi_handle_scope** in the following example.

![cppcrash-demo9](figures/cppcrash_image_016.png)

On the JS side, data is added using the **Add()**, and on the native side, **napi_value** is saved to a **vector**. On the JS side, data is obtained using the **get** API, and on the native side, the saved **napi_value** is returned as an array. The JS side then reads the properties of the data. The error message "Can not get Prototype on non ECMA Object" is displayed. The **native_value** across **napi** is not saved using **napi_ref**. As a result, the **native_value** is invalid.
> **NOTE**
>
> You can manage the lifecycle of **napi_value** using **napi_handle_scope**, which starts before the native method is called and ends after the native method is executed. For details, see [Performing Lifecycle Management Using Node-API](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/use-napi-life-cycle).

### Case 5: SIGABRT Crash

**SIGABRT** crashes usually occur when the process calls the **abort** function of the standard function library. They are triggered when the program detects exceptions, such as thread creation failure or file descriptor usage exceptions, particularly when basic libraries (such as the C library) perform verifications.

```c++
static napi_value TriggerCrash(napi_env env, napi_callback_info info)
{
    OH_LOG_FATAL(LOG_APP, "test fatal log.");
    abort();
    return 0;
}
```

![cppcrash-demo4](figures/cppcrash_image_008.png)

This example constructs a scenario where the **abort** function is proactively called to describe how to analyze the **SIGABRT** crash. As shown in the preceding figure, **LastFatalMessage** provides the cause of the abnormal exits for the **SIGABRT** crash, which helps to locate the fault. Skip the call stack of the C library, find the call stack (#02 call stack in the figure) that calls the **abort** function, and analyze the call stack based on **LastFatalMessage**.

In C++, the **assert** function is also used for exception handling. When the **assert** function is called to verify data during the execution of the current function and the verification fails, the process exits automatically. In this case, the method for analyzing the problem is the same as that for the **abort** function.

```c++
static napi_value TriggerCrash(napi_env env, napi_callback_info info)
{
    void *pc = malloc(1024);
    assert(pc != nullptr);
    return 0;
}
```

## Appendix

### C++ Crash Signals

Based on the POSIX signal mechanism, the following crash signals can be detected.

| Signo| Signal| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 4 | SIGILL | Invalid instruction| An invalid, incorrectly formatted, unknown, or privileged instruction is executed.|
| 5 | SIGTRAP | Breakpoint or trap| An exception occurs or a trap instruction is executed.|
| 6 | SIGABRT | Process abort| The process is aborted abnormally. Generally, this exception occurs when the process calls **abort()** in the Standard Function Library.|
| 7 | SIGBUS | Illegal memory access| The process accesses an aligned or nonexistent physical address.|
| 8 | SIGFPE | Floating-point exception| An incorrect arithmetic operation is executed, for example, a 0 divisor, floating point overflow, or integer overflow.|
| 11 | SIGSEGV | Invalid memory access| The process accesses an invalid memory region.|
| 16 | SIGSTKFLT | Stack error| The processor performs an incorrect stack operation, such as a pop when the stack is empty or a push when the stack is full.|
| 31 | SIGSYS | Incorrect system call| An incorrect or invalid parameter is used in a system call.|

Some of the preceding signals are further classified into codes based on specific scenarios. 
**SIGILL** indicates an invalid instruction exception in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The trigger causes of **SIGILL** are as follows.

| Code| Value| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | ILL_ILLOPC | Illegal operation code.| A privileged instruction or an instruction that is unsupported by the CPU is executed.|
| 2 | ILL_ILLOPN | Illegal operand.| An incorrect operand or improper operand type is used.|
| 3 | ILL_ILLADR | Illegal address.| A program accesses an invalid memory address or an unaligned memory address.|
| 4 | ILL_ILLTRP | Illegal trap.| A program performs an illegal trap instruction or an undefined operation.|
| 5 | ILL_PRVOPC | Illegal privileged operation code.| A common user executes a privileged instruction.|
| 6 | ILL_PRVREG | Illegal privileged register.|  A common user accesses a privileged register.|
| 7 | ILL_COPROC | Illegal coprocessor.| A program performs an undefined coprocessor instruction.|
| 8 | ILL_BADSTK | Illegal stack.| A program performs an operation at an invalid stack address, or when the stack overflows.|

**SIGTRAP** usually occurs in debugging and tracking. The trigger causes of **SIGTRAP** are as follows.

| Code| Value| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | TRAP_BRKPT | Software breakpoint.| The program reaches the software breakpoint. When debugging a program, a software breakpoint at the key position can be used to pause the program execution and check information such as variable values.|
| 2 | TRAP_TRACE | Single-step debugging.| The program executes a single instruction. Single instruction can be used to check the execution result of each instruction.|
| 3 | TRAP_BRANCH | Branch tracing.| The program executes a branch instruction. Branch instruction can be used to control the execution process of a program, such as if statements and loop statements.|
| 4 | TRAP_HWBKPT | Hardware breakpoint.| The program reaches the hardware breakpoint. When debugging a program, a hardware breakpoint at the key position can be used to pause the program execution and check information such as variable values. Different from a software breakpoint, a hardware breakpoint is implemented in CPU hardware. Therefore, whether a hardware breakpoint is triggered can be detected in real time during program execution.|

The **SIGBUS** signal is sent by the operating system to a process. It usually indicates a memory access error. The trigger causes of **SIGBUS** are as follows.

| Code| Value| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | BUS_ADRALN | Unaligned memory address.| The program accesses an unaligned memory address, for example, a non-even address of a 4-byte integer.|
| 2 | BUS_ADRERR | Invalid memory address.| The program accesses a memory address that does not exist in the process address space, such as a null pointer.|
| 3 | BUS_OBJERR | Invalid object access.| The program accesses a deleted or uninitialized object.|
| 4 | BUS_MCEERR_AR | Invalid hardware memory check.| A checksum error is detected when the hardware memory is accessed.|
| 5 | BUS_MCEERR_AO | Invalid hardware memory check.| An address check error is detected when the hardware memory is accessed.|

The **SIGFPE** signal indicates a floating-point exception or an arithmetic exception. The trigger causes of **SIGFPE** are as follows.

| Code| Value| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | FPE_INTDIV | Invalid integer division.|  The program performs an integer division operation while the divisor is zero.|
| 2 | FPE_INTOVF | Integer overflow.|  The program performs an integer operation and the result exceeds the integer range.|
| 3 | FPE_FLTDIV | Invalid floating-point division.|  The program performs a floating-point division operation while the divisor is zero.|
| 4 | FPE_FLTOVF | Floating-point overflow error.|  The program performs a floating-point operation and the result exceeds the upper limit of the floating-point number.|
| 5 | FPE_FLTUND | Floating-point underflow error.|  The program performs a floating-point operation and the result is less than the lower limit of the floating-point number.|
| 6 | FPE_FLTRES | Invalid floating-point result.|  The program performs a floating-point operation and the result is undefined.|
| 7 | FPE_FLTINV | Invalid floating-point operation.|  A program performs an invalid floating-point operation.|
| 8 | FPE_FLTSUB | Invalid floating-point operation result.|  A program attempts to perform a floating-point operation and the floating-point result is out of range.|

**SIGSEGV** occurs when a process accesses a non-existent memory address or an inaccessible address. The trigger causes of the **SIGSEGV** signal are described as follows:

| Code| Value| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | SEGV_MAPERR | Non-existent memory address.| A process accesses a memory address that does not exist or that is not mapped to the process address space. This exception is usually caused by pointer errors or memory leaks.|
| 2 | SEGV_ACCERR | Inaccessible memory address.| A process accesses an inaccessible memory address marked by the operating system, such as a read-only memory address or a memory address without execution permission. This exception is usually caused by buffer overflow or modifying read-only memory.|

The classification of codes cannot only be based on signals, but also on their underlying causes. The code values classified by causes are as follows.

| Code| Value| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0 | SI_USER | User space.| Sent from a process in user space to another process, usually using **kill()**. For example, when a user presses **Ctrl+C** on the terminal, a **SIGINT** signal is sent to all foreground processes.|
| 0x80 | SI_KERNEL | Kernel.| Sent from the kernel to a process when the kernel detects an error or exception. For example, when a process accesses an invalid memory address or executes an invalid instruction, the kernel sends a **SIGSEGV** signal to the process.|
| -1 | SI_QUEUE | The **sigqueue()** function.| Sent from **sigqueue()**, with an additional integer value and a pointer can be carried. It is usually used for advanced communication between processes, such as transferring data or notifying a process that an event occurs.|
| -2 | SI_TIMER | Timer.| Sent from a timer for executing scheduled tasks or periodic tasks. For example, when a timer expires, the kernel sends a **SIGALRM** signal to the process.|
| -3 | SI_MESGQ | Message queue.| Sent from a message queue for inter-process communication. For example, when a process sends a message to a message queue, the kernel sends a **SIGIO** signal to the receiving process.|
| -4 | SI_ASYNCIO | Asynchronous I/O.| Sent from an asynchronous I/O operation for non-blocking I/O operations. For example, when an I/O operation on a file descriptor is complete, the kernel sends a **SIGIO** signal to the process.|
| -5 | SI_SIGIO | Synchronous I/O.| Sent from an asynchronous I/O operation for non-blocking I/O operations. For example, when an I/O operation on a file descriptor is complete, the kernel sends a **SIGIO** signal to the process.|
| -6 | SI_TKILL | The **tkill()** function.| Sent from the function **tkill()**, which is similar to the function **kill()**. Moreover, you can specify the ID of the thread that sends the signal using **tkill()**. It is usually used to send a signal to a specified thread in a multithreaded program.|

> **NOTE**
>
> - The file name may also be an anonymous memory mapping, for example, **[heap]** or **[stack]**.
> - The possible causes for the failure to print function names in logs are as follows:
>
> - The function name is not saved in the binary file.
>
> - The length of the function name saved in the binary file exceeds 256 bytes.
>
> - If **BuildID** is not displayed, run the **readelf -n xxx.so** command to check whether the binary file contains **BuildID**. If not, add the compilation parameter **--enable-linker-build-id** and do not add **--build-id=none** to **LDFLAGS**.

The 64-bit ARM system can capture cross-language call stacks between C++ and JS. Therefore, if the function call chain contains JS code, the crash log also records the JS call stack in the following format:

```text
#00 at onPageShow (entry|har1|1.0.0|src/main/ets/pages/Index.ts:7:13)
```

For details, see [Exception Code Call Stack Formats](jscrash-guidelines.md#exception-code-call-stack-formats).

#### Null Pointer Dereferences

Null pointer dereference often  occurs in the following scenarios:

- When a crash is in format of **SIGSEGV(SEGV_MAPERR)@0x00000000** or the values of the registers such as **r0** and **r1** in the **Register** field are **0**, a null pointer may be passed in when the function is called. 

- When a crash is in format of **SIGSEGV(SEGV_MAPERR)@0x0000000c** (smaller than the size of a memory page) or the value of the registers such as **r1** in the **Register** field is small, a null pointer may be passed in when the struct member of the input parameter is called.

In this scenario, a message is printed in the log, indicating that the fault may be caused by a null pointer dereference. The following is an example process crash log archived by DevEco Studio in FaultLog:

#### Stack Overflows

Stack overflow is likely to occur in the following scenarios:

- The stack memory is used up because the recursive termination condition is not set during recursive call.
- The stack memory is used up because local variables occupy too much stack memory.
- The stack memory used in the signal stack exceeds the system limit.

```c++
static void *DoStackOverflow(void * inputArg)
{
    int b[10] = {1};
    int *c = nullptr;
    (void)memcpy_s(c, sizeof(int), b, sizeof(int));
    if (b[0] == 0) {
        return static_cast<void*>(b + 9); // 9: last element of array
    }
    DoStackOverflow(inputArg);
    return static_cast<void*>(b + 9); // 9: last element of array
}
```

**DoStackOverflow** is called recursively for multiple times. As a result, the memory is read and written outside the stack after the stack memory is used up, and a crash occurs.

In this scenario, a message is recorded in the log, indicating that the fault may be caused by stack overflow. The following is an example process crash log archived by DevEco Studio in FaultLog:

#### Stack Corruptions

Stack corruptions occur when the stack memory that stores function call information is overwritten during service code running. As a result, the call stack cannot be traced. In this scenario, the system displays a message in the log, indicating that you need to parse the unreliable call stack in the thread stack memory from **#xx**.  

An unreliable call stack indicates an incomplete call chain. That is, two adjacent stacks starting from the **#xx** layer may have no call relationship. Therefore, you need to analyze the call chain based on the service code. In the following example, the correct call sequence is **#05->#04->#03->#01**.

#### Asynchronous Thread Call Stack Tracing Faults

When an asynchronous thread crashes, the stack of the thread that submits the asynchronous task is also displayed to help locate the crash. Currently, the ARM64 architecture is supported on the debug application (**HAP_DEBUGGABLE**). The call stack of the crash thread and that of the submission thread are separated by **SubmitterStacktrace**. The following is an example process crash log archived by DevEco Studio in FaultLog:

### Reading Assembly Instructions

#### Using llvm-objdump

llvm-objdump is a disassembler provided by the system. It is archived in [SDK DIR PATH]/default/openharmony/native/llvm/bin/llvm-objdump.exe. You can run the following command to use it:

```text
llvm-objdump.exe -d -l libark_jsruntime.so > dump.txt
```

This command is used to export the full assembly instructions of **libark_jsruntime.so** to the **dump.txt** file.

#### Cases

The core C ++ crash logs are as follows:

```text
Process name:com.ohos.medialibrary.medialibrarydata
Process life time:13402s
Reason:SIGSEGV(SEGV_MAPERR)@0x0000005b3b46c000
Fault thread info:
Tid:48552, Name:UpradeTask
#00 pc 00000000000a87e4 /system/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1(memcpy+356)(3c3e7fb27680dc2ee99aa08dd0f81e85)
...
```

Analysis procedure:

- Based on the PC register address, find the corresponding assembly instruction and determine the instruction that crashes when it is executed.

    In the C++ crash log file, find the PC address at the stack top and disassemble the corresponding binary codes.
    For example, if a crash occurs when the instruction corresponding to the address **00000000000a87e4** is executed, disassemble the **0xa87e4** offset address in the **ld-musl-aarch64.so.1** file to display the instruction information.

    ```text
    xxx/../../third_party/optimized-routines/string/aarch64/memcpy.S:175 <- Line number of the source code
    a87e4:   a94371aa         ldp x10, x11, [x1, #48]
    Address:    Value                   Assembly instruction
    ```

    **ldp** indicates an LDP instruction, which is used to load two 64-bit data from the memory to two different registers at the same time.

    ```text
    ldp    x10,        x11,    [x1, #48]
    LDP Target register 1 Target register 2 <source address>
    ```

    This instruction reads two consecutive 64-bit data from the specified position (determined by the address in register **x1** plus a 48-byte offset) in the memory and store the data to registers **x10** and **x11**.

    Check the code of the **memcpy.S** source file corresponding to line 175:

    ```text
    L(loop64):
    line 170   stp A_l, A_h, [dst, 16]
    line 171   ldp A_l, A_h, [src, 16]
    line 172   stp B_l, B_h, [dst, 32]
    line 173   ldp B_l, B_h, [src, 32]
    line 174   stp C_l, C_h, [dst, 48]
    line 175   ldp C_l, C_h, [src, 48]      <-  The crash instruction
    line 176   stp D_l, D_h, [dst, 64]
    line 177   ldp D_l, D_h, [src, 64]
    line 178   subs count, count, 64
    line 179   b.hi L(loop64)
    ```

- Based on the register value and context, determine which object causes the fault.

    For a non-class member function, the **x0** register loads the first parameter of the function, **x1** loads the second parameter, **x2** loads the third parameter, and so on. For a class member function, **x0** loads the pointer to the class instance object, and **x1**, **x2**, and **x3** load parameters. Note that if the number of function parameters exceeds 5, the parameters are pushed into the stack. For the parameters of **void* memcpy(void* restrict dest, void* restrict src, size_t n)** in the stack top, **x0** loads **dest** (destination address), **x1** loads **src** (source address), and **x2** loads **n** (number of copied bytes).

    ```text
    Register:
    x0:000005b50c3e3c4 x1:000005b3b46bfcc x2:0000000000007e88 x3:000005b50c42380
    ...
    ```

    Based on the three register values in C++ crash logs and the crash address **0x0000005b3b46c000**, it is determined that the faulty parameter is the second parameter (source address) of the **memcpy** function.

3. Determine the fault type based on the memory features near the crash address.

    Check **Memory near registers** in the C++ crash logs:

    ```text
    x1(xxxx):
        0000005b3b46bf84 8067d0f2e727f00a
        0000005b3b46bf8c 1b10e1e9a1079f7a
        0000005b3b46bf94 83906d9c18cdb9c1

        0000005b3b46bfac f981e4acb716cbc1
        0000005b3b46bfb4 806b3d5730d281ee
        0000005b3b46bfbc 3e99fedbc0a9b5e9
        0000005b3b46bfc4 a91ab9d327969682
        0000005b3b46bfcc ffffffffffffffff       -----> Out-of-bounds read
        0000005b21bb2008 ffffffffffffffff
        0000005b21bb2010 ffffffffffffffff
        0000005b21bb2018 ffffffffffffffff
        0000005b21bb2020 ffffffffffffffff
        0000005b21bb2028 ffffffffffffffff
        0000005b21bb2030 ffffffffffffffff
    ```

    According to the log, an out-of-bound read problem occurs. You only need to analyze the input parameters **src** (pointer to the source memory) and **n** (number of copied bytes) of **memcpy**.

4. Track the parameter source of the problematic object and locate the problem based on the code and HiLog logs.

    - Check whether the parameter object is valid and whether the value range is valid. For example, check whether the size of the source memory is the same as the value of **n**.

    - Check whether the lifecycle of the parameter object is valid. For example, check whether the source memory has been released and whether there are multi-thread operation objects.

    - Check the improper operation logic of parameters based on the function context. For example, trace the operation logic of **buf** and **bufsize**, add debugging information, and locate the improper operation logic. The context segment is as follows:

    ```c++
    static StatusInter xxxFunc(const uint8_t *buf, uint32_t bufSize)
    {
    // ...
    uint32_t srcSize = bufSize;
    uint32_t srcOffset = cache->appendOffset - bufSize;
    errno_t ret = memcpy_s(cache->buffer + srcOffset, srcSize, buf, bufSize); 
    if (ret != EOK) {
        return MEMORY_OPERATE_FAILED_INTER;
    }
    // ...
    }
    ```

    By continuously tracing the sources of **buf** and **bufSize**, it is found that the value of **bufSize** is greater than that of **buf** after continuous copy. As a result, an out-of-bounds read problem occurs.
