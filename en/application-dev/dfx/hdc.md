# hdc

OpenHarmony Device Connector (hdc) is a command line tool used for debugging. You can use it on a Windows, Linux, or macOS system to interact with devices.

hdc consists of three processes:

**client**: the process running on the PC. This process is started when you run the hdc command and exits after the command is executed.

**server**: the background server process running on the PC. It is used to manage data interaction between the **client** and **daemon** processes and discover devices.

**daemon**: the daemon process running on the device. It is used to respond to the requests sent by **server**.

The following figure shows the relationship.

![hdc](figures/hdc_image_005.PNG)
> **NOTE**
>
> When **client** is started, it checks whether **server** is running by default. If not, a new hdc program is started as the **server** and runs in the background.
>
> When **server** is running, it listens for port 8710 of the PC by default. You can set the system environment variable **OHOS_HDC_SERVER_PORT** to listen for a port.

## Environment Setup

Download and install [DevEco Studio](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/deveco-studio/). You can obtain the hdc application in **DevEco Studio/sdk/default/openharmony/toolchains**.

### (Optional) Running the hdc Program on the CLI

You can go to the **toolchains** directory of SDK through the CLI and run the hdc command in the directory for debugging.
To facilitate the execution of the hdc program in the CLI, you can add the file path of the hdc program to the system environment variable that specifies the command search path.
For example, add it to **Path** on Windows.

### (Optional) Configuring the hdc Server

You can set the listening port, log output level, feature switch, and command recording of the hdc server by configuring the corresponding system environment variables. For details, see [Optional Configuration Items](#optional-configuration-items).

> **NOTE**
>
> After the environment variable is configured, close and restart the CLI and other software that uses OpenHarmony SDK.

### Common Connections

#### USB Connection

- Checking the environment

| Item| Normal| Exception Handling|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| USB debugging| USB debugging is enabled.| If the USB debugging mode is not automatically enabled, restart the device.|
| USB data cable connection| The PC used for debugging is connected to the device USB port using a USB cable.| If you use a USB cable with low bandwidth and no data communication function, the device may fail to be identified. You are advised to use an officially recommended USB cable.|
| USB port| A USB port on the mainboard (USB port on the rear panel of a desktop computer or USB port on a laptop computer) is used.| If you use a conversion adapter, docking station, or USB port on the front panel of a desktop computer, issues such as low bandwidth and USB sync problems may occur, which results in frequent disconnections. Therefore, direct connection between the PC and the device is recommended.|
| hdc environment variable| The help information is displayed after the **hdc -h** command is executed.| For details, see [Environment Setup](#environment-setup).|
| Driver| After the device is connected via hdc, **HDC Device** or **HDC Interface** is displayed in **Device Manager**.| For details, see [Failed to Identify the Target Device](#failed-to-identify-the-target-device).|

- Procedure

1. Connect the PC to the device through a USB port.

2. Check the connection.

   ```shell
   hdc list targets
   ```

   If the corresponding device ID is returned, the USB connection is successful.

3. When the device is found, run the related commands to interact with the device. If you want to perform USB command operations without the device ID, ensure that the device is not in TCP connection mode (the device information displayed by running the **hdc list targets** command does not contain **IP:port**) and directly connect to the device. For example:

   ```shell
   hdc shell
   ```

#### TCP Connection

   > **NOTE**
   >
   > The TCP debugging function is not stable. Exercise caution when using this function for production.

- Checking the environment

| Item| Normal| Exception Handling|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Network connection| The PC and the device are on the same network.| Connect the PC and device to the same Wi-Fi network or enable the Wi-Fi hotspot on your device.|
| Network Status| Use **telnet IP:port** to check that the network connection between the PC and the device is normal.| Connect the PC and the device over a stable network.|
| hdc environment variable| The help information is displayed after the **hdc -h** command is executed.| For details, see [Environment Setup](#environment-setup).|

- Procedure

1. Enable network debugging on the device setting page.

2. Record the port number displayed on the device as **PORT** for TCP connection.

3. Run the following command to connect to the device through TCP (you need to know the device IP address and enabled port number):

   ```shell
   hdc tconn IP:PORT
   ```
   You can obtain the IP address from the device settings. The port number is displayed in the previous step.

4. Check the connection.

   ```shell
   hdc list targets
   ```

   If the return value is in the *IP:PORT* format, the connection is successful.

5. To disable the TCP connection mode, disable network debugging on the device.

#### Remote Connection

In the remote connection scenario, the client remotely connects to the server through the network. The client and server run on different PCs, and the server connects to the device.
The following figure shows the remote connection.

![Remote connection structure](figures/hdc_image_004.PNG)

The hdc client runs on PC1, and the hdc server runs on PC2, which is connected to the device.

- Connection command

   | Command| Description|
   | -------- | -------- |
   | -s | Specifies the IP address and port number of the current server process to listen for.|

   Use the **-s** parameter to specify the IP address and port number of the server. The setting is valid only when the current command is executed.

   ```shell
   hdc -s [ip]:[port] [command]
   ```

   **Parameters**
   | Parameter| Description|
   | -------- | -------- |
   | ip | IP address to listen for. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported.|
   | port | Port to listen for. The value ranges from 1 to 65535.|

   **Usage**

   ```shell
   # Run the command to obtain the device information in the server process of 127.0.0.1:8710:
   hdc -s 127.0.0.1:8710 list targets
   ```

   > **NOTE**
   >
   > If the **-s** parameter is used to specify a server port, the system ignores the port set in the **OHOS_HDC_SERVER_PORT** environment variable.

- Procedure

   1. Configure the server

   Connect the server to the device using a USB cable and run the following commands:

   ```shell
   hdc kill          // Terminate the local hdc server.
   hdc -s IP:8710 -m // Enable the hdc server for network forwarding.
                     // In the command, IP indicates the IP address of the server. To query the IP address, you can run the **ipconfig** command on Windows and run the **ifconfig** command on Unix.
                     // 8710 is the default port number. You can also set it to another port number, for example, 18710.
                     // After startup, the server prints logs.
   ```

   2. Connect to the client

   Ensure that the client can connect to the server IP address, and then run the following command:

   ```shell
   hdc -s IP:8710 [command] // IP indicates the IP address of the server, and 8710 indicates the port number set when the server is started in step 1.
                           // If the port number changes, change the port number accordingly.
                           // and command can be any available hdc command, for example, list targets.
   ```

## hdc Debugging Logs

### Server Logs

#### Specifying the Log Level

Specify the hdc log level. The default value is **LOG_INFO**. 

   ```shell
   hdc -l [level] [command]
   ```

   **Parameters**
| Parameter| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| [level] | Log Level<br>0: LOG_OFF<br>1: LOG_FATAL<br>2: LOG_WARN<br>3: LOG_INFO<br>4: LOG_DEBUG<br>5: LOG_ALL<br>6: LOG_LIBUSB|
| command | Command to be executed.|

   > **NOTE**
   >
   > 1. When the log level is set to 6 (**LOG_LIBUSB**), incremental logs related to libusb are generated. The incremental logs are detailed and contain a large amount of data, which helps accurately diagnose USB-related exceptions in server processes. USB-related operations are mainly performed by server processes. Therefore, incremental logs are available only for server processes. Accordingly, the client logs almost do not contain incremental log information.
   > 2. You can change only the log levels of the current client and server processes.

   **Return value**
| Return Value| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| Command output| Command execution result, which may vary with the command.|
| Log information| Logs of the specified level.|

   **Usage**

   Run the **shell ls** command with the log level specified to **LOG_DEBUG**.

   ```shell
   hdc -l 5 shell ls
   ```

   Run the **-m** command with the log level specify to **LOG_LIBUSB**.

   ```shell
   hdc kill && hdc -l 6 -m
   ```

   > **NOTE**
   > The **-m** parameter is used to start the server process in the foreground. You can directly view the foreground log output and press **Ctrl+C** to exit the process.

   Start the server process in the background with the log level set to **LOG_LIBUSB**.

   ```shell
   hdc kill && hdc -l 6 start
   ```

   > **NOTE**
   > When the server process is started in the background, you can view the log output in **hdc.log**. For details about the log path, see **Obtaining Logs**.

#### Obtaining Logs

Obtain server logs.

```shell
hdc kill
hdc -l5 start
```

The collected logs are stored in the following path.

| OS| Path| Remarks|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Windows | %temp% | Example: **C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Temp**.<br>Replace *Username* with the actual one.|
| Linux | /tmp | - |
| macOS| $TMPDIR | - |

Log-related environment variables

| Environment Variable            | Default Value| Description                            |
|--------------------|-----|--------------------------------|
| OHOS_HDC_LOG_LEVEL | 5   | The log level of the server process.<br>For details, see [Server Logs](#server-logs). |


### Device Logs

Enable HiLog to obtain the corresponding logs.

```shell
hdc shell hilog -w start                             // Enable the function of storing HiLog logs.
hdc shell ls /data/log/hilog                     // View the stored HiLog logs.
hdc file recv /data/log/hilog                  // Obtain the stored HiLog logs (including kernel logs).
```

## Optional Configuration Items

### OHOS_HDC_SERVER_PORT

 

Sets the port of the hdc server to listen for. This port is used for data communication between the hdc client and hdc server. The default value of this parameter is **8710**.

When the hdc server is started, it listens for port 8710 of the PC by default. The hdc client uses TCP to connect to the server through this port. If port 8710 of the PC has been used or you want to use another port, you can add the environment variable **OHOS_HDC_SERVER_PORT** to the system environment variable to listen for any unoccupied port when the server is started. You can set the port number to a value ranging from 1 to 65535.

For example, set **OHOS_HDC_SERVER_PORT** to **18710**.

### OHOS_HDC_LOG_LEVEL

 

Sets the log level of the service process. The default value of this parameter is **3**. For details about the log level, see "Log Level" in [Server Logs](#server-logs).

### OHOS_HDC_HEARTBEAT

 

Sets whether to enable the heartbeat functionality for the hdc server and hdc daemon. This functionality is enabled by default.

After the hdc server and hdc daemon are started, they send heartbeat packets to each other and record the heartbeat packets in hdc logs for checking the device connection status.

When the environment variable **OHOS_HDC_HEARTBEAT** is set to **1** for the hdc server, its heartbeat functionality is disabled. When the device is connected to the PC, the hdc server notifies the hdc daemon that the heartbeat functionality is disabled and does not send heartbeat packets to each other.

When **OHOS_HDC_HEARTBEAT** is set to other values, the heartbeat function is enabled.

### OHOS_HDC_CMD_RECORD


Sets whether to enable the hdc command recording functionality. This functionality is enabled by default. This functionality records only the executed hdc commands but not the command execution results.

When this parameter is set to **1**, the command recording functionality is enabled. When it is not set or set to any other number, the command recording functionality is disabled.

This parameter is supported since API version 20.

Paths for storing recording logs:

| OS| Path| Remarks|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Windows | %temp%\hdc_cmd\ | Example: **C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Temp\hdc_cmd\**.<br>Replace *Username* with the actual one.|
| Linux | /tmp/hdc_cmd/ | - |
| macOS| $TMPDIR/hdc_cmd/ | - |

### Configuring Environment Variables

In the following example, the **OHOS_HDC_CMD_RECORD** environment variable is set to **1**.

| OS| Configuration Method|
|---|---|
| Windows  | Choose **This PC >Properties >Advanced system settings >Advanced >Environment Variables**, add the environment variable **OHOS_HDC_CMD_RECORD**, and set its value to **1**. After the configuration is complete, click **OK**. Restart the CLI or other software that uses OpenHarmony SDK for the new environment variable to take effect. |
| Linux  | Add **export OHOS_HDC_CMD_RECORD=1** to the end of the **~/.bash_profile** file, save the file, and run the **source ~/.bash_profile** command for the current environment variable to take effect.|
| macOS | Add **export OHOS_HDC_CMD_RECORD=1** to the end of the **~/.zshrc** file, save the file, and run the **source ~/.zshrc** command for the current environment variable to take effect. Restart the CLI or other software that uses OpenHarmony SDK for the new environment variable to take effect.|

## FAQs

### Failed to Identify the Target Device

**Symptom**

After the **hdc list targets** command is executed, the command output is **[empty]**.

**Possible Causes and Solution**

Perform the following operations to locate the fault.

- Case 1: Check whether the target device is displayed in **Device Manager**.

   Windows:

   Check whether **HDC Device** (for a single-port device) or **HDC Interface** (for a composite device) exists under **Universal Serial Bus Controllers** in **Device Manager**.

   Linux:

   Run the **lsusb** command. Check whether **HDC Device** or **HDC Interface** is displayed in the command output.

   macOS:

   View USB devices in **System Information** or **System Overview**.

   1. Press and hold the **Option** key, and click **Menu**.

   2. Choose **System Information** or **System Overview**.

   3. Select **USB** on the left.

   4. Check whether **HDC Device** or **HDC Interface** exists in the device tree.

   **Solution**

   If the device is not displayed, it fails to be identified. You can use any of the following methods to resolve the problem:

   - Use another physical USB port.
   - Replace the USB cable.
   - Use another PC for debugging.
   - Enable the USB debugging mode.
   - Click **OK** to allow USB debugging.
   - If a TCP connection can be set up, run the **hdc tmode usb** command to switch to the USB connection.
   - Restore the factory settings of the device.

- Case 2: A USB device exists, but the driver is damaged. **HDC Device** with a warning icon in yellow is displayed.

   This problem usually occurs in Windows. In **Device Manager/Universal Serial Bus Device**, **HDC Device** is displayed with a yellow warning icon, indicating that the device cannot work properly. To resolve the problem, reinstall the driver. If the problem persists, use another USB cable, docking station, or USB port.

   **Reinstalling the Driver**

   1. Open **Device Manager**, and right-click the **HDC Device** with a warning icon.

   2. In the displayed menu, choose **Update driver**.

   3. In the first prompt window, select **Browse my computer for drivers**.

   4. In the second prompt window, select **Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer**.

   5. In the third prompt window, deselect **Show compatible hardware**, select **WinUsb Device** for **Manufacture** and **WinUsb Device** for **Model**, and click **Next**.

- Case 3: "[Fail]Failed to communicate with daemon" is displayed when the device is connected. 

   When "[Fail]Failed to communicate with daemon" is displayed after a hdc command is executed.

   Possible causes are as follows:

   - The hdc or SDK does not match the device. If the device is the latest version, update the hdc or SDK tool to the latest version.
   - The port is occupied.

   This problem usually occurs when hdc and hdc_std use the same **OHOS_HDC_SERVER_PORT** or the same default port **8710**. Ensure that either hdc or hdc_std is running. This problem also occurs when other software occupies the default hdc port.

- Case 4: "Connect server failed" is displayed when the device is connected.

   The possible causes are as follows:

   - **Port Preemption**

      Solution:
      1. Check the software processes that come with hdc, including software with built-in hdc, such as DevEco Studio and DevEco Testing.

         Stop these software processes and run hdc commands.

      2. Check hdc port status.

         For example, if **OHOS_HDC_SERVER_PORT** is set to **8710**, run the following command to check the port status.

         Unix:

         ```shell
         netstat -an |grep 8710
         ```

         Windows:

         ```shell
         netstat -an |findstr 8710
         ```

         If the port is used by another software, stop the software process or change the **OHOS_HDC_SERVER_PORT** environment variable to another port number.

      3. Check for and stop the hdc server of another version.

         Windows:

         Choose **Task Manager** > **Details**, right-click the **hdc.exe** process and choose **Open file location**. Check whether the location is the same as that configured in the environment variable. If not, stop the **hdc.exe** process by running the **hdc kill** command or terminating the process in **Task Manager**. Then, run the hdc command again. (The hdc server will be restarted by running the hdc command.)

         Unix:

         Run the **ps -ef |grep hdc** command to query the hdc server process running in the background and check whether the process startup location is the hdc file location set by the environment variable **Path**. If not, stop the hdc process by running the **hdc kill** or **kill -9 hdc** *PID* command, and run the hdc command again. (The hdc server will be restarted by running the hdc command.)

   - **Registry Exception**

      Solution: Clear the registry. The procedure is as follows:

      1. Press **Win+R** to open the **Run** dialog box, and enter **regedit** to open the registry.
      2. Enter the following address in the address bar, and press **Enter** to access the registry of the USB device driver.

         ```shell
         Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{88bae032-5a81-49f0-bc3d-a4ff138216d6}
         ```

      3. Right-click **UpperFilters** and choose **Edit**. Back up and clear the value data. The backup data can be used to restore the value data if the problem persists.
      4. Refresh the **Device Manager**, remove and reconnect the USB cable to the USB port, or restart the PC.

**The non-root user cannot find the device using hdc in Linux**

In Linux, you can enable the USB device operation permission for non-root users as follows:

- To temporarily grant the full operation permission on a USB device, run the following command:

   ```shell
   sudo chmod -R 777 /dev/bus/usb/
   ```

- To permanently change the operation permission on a USB device, do as follows:

   1. Run the **lsusb** command to obtain the **vendorID** and **productID** of the USB device.

   2. Create an **udev** rule.

      Edit the **udev** loading rule and replace the default **idVendor** and **idProduct** values of the device with the values obtained in the previous step.

      **MODE="0666"** indicates the permissions of **GROUP** (the user group) for the USB device. Ensure that the login user is in the user group.

         ```shell
         sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/90-myusb.rules
         SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="067b", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2303", GROUP="users", MODE="0666"
         ```

   3. Restart the computer or reload the **udev** rule.

         ```shell
         sudo udevadm control --reload
         ```

> **NOTE**
> A non-root user cannot find the device using hdc in Linux. Granting USB operation permission for non-root users can solve this problem. However, granting the full permission may pose potential security risks. You need to determine whether to grant the permission based on actual requirements.

### Failed to Run hdc

**Symptom**

The **hdc.exe**/hdc binary file cannot be executed using the CLI.

**Possible Causes and Solution**

- Incorrect runtime environment.

   Linux: Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit or later is recommended. If **libc++.so** reference errors are reported, run the **ldd** or **readelf** command to check library reference.

   macOS: macOS 11 or later is recommended.

   Windows: Windows 10 or Windows 11 64-bit is recommended. If the WinUSB library or driver is missing in an earlier version, use [Zadig](https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/releases) to update it. For Windows 10 or Windows 11 64-bit, use [Zadig](https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/releases) to install the libusb-win32 driver. For details, see [Zadig](https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/releases).

- Improper running mode: Use the correct command to run the hdc tool instead of double-clicking the file.

### Common Procedure for Troubleshooting Other Problems

1. Run the **hdc list targets** command.
2. Check whether **HDC Device** exists in **Device Manager**.
3. Run the **hdc kill** command to terminate the server, and then run the **hdc -l5 start** command to collect logs. (The **hdc.log** file is stored in the **TEMP** directory on the execution end. The directory location varies with the OS. For details, see [Server Logs](#server-logs).)
4. Locate the problem based on the **hdc.log** file.

## hdc Error Codes

### E003001 The Specified Bundle Name Is Invalid

**Error Message**

Invalid bundle name: _bundlename_

**Symptom**

The **_bundlename_** specified in the **hdc shell [-b bundlename] [command]** command is not the bundle name of an installed debug application, or the application directory does not exist.

**Possible Causes**

* Scenario 1: The specified application is not installed on the device.

* Scenario 2: The specified application is not a debug application.

* Scenario 3: The specified application is not started.

**Solution**

* Scenario 1: Ensure that the application specified in the command has been installed on the device.

   a. Run the **hdc shell "bm dump -a | grep bundlename"** command to check whether the application corresponding to the bundle name has been installed on the device. The expected result is **_bundlename_**.
   
   For example, if the bundle name is **com.example.myapplication**, run the following command:

   ```shell
   hdc shell "bm dump -a | grep com.example.myapplication"
   ```

   If the bundle has been installed on the device, the following information is returned:

   ```shell
   com.example.myapplication
   ```

   b. If the application is a debug application but is not installed on the device, run the **hdc install [app_path]** command to install it.

   c. If the application is not a debug application but a release application, the** _bundlename_** cannot be specified.

* Scenario 2: Run the **hdc shell "bm dump -n bundlename | grep appProvisionType"** command to check whether the application specified in the command can be debugged. The expected output is **"appProvisionType": "debug"**.

   For example, run the following command to check the bundle name **com.example.myapplication**:

   ```shell
   hdc shell "bm dump -n com.example.myapplication | grep appProvisionType"
   ```

   If the application is a debug application, the following information is displayed:

   ```shell
   "appProvisionType": "debug",
   ```

   To build a debug application, you need to use a debug certificate for signature. For details about how to request and use the debug certificate, see [Requesting a Debug Certificate](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/app/agc-help-add-debugcert-0000001914263178).

* Scenario 3: Ensure that the bundle specified by the command has been started.

   a. Run the **hdc shell "mount |grep bundlename"** command to check whether the resource directory is mounted after the bundle is started.

   For example, to check the bundle name **com.example.myapplication**, run the following command:

   ```shell
   hdc shell "mount |grep com.example.myapplication"
   ```

   If the corresponding resource directory has been mounted, mounting information is expected to be returned. (The returned information varies according to the actual mounting status and is not displayed here.)

   If the corresponding resource directory is not mounted, no information is returned.

   b. If the corresponding resource directory is not mounted, you can click the application or run the **aa** command to start the application.

   For example, to start the application whose name is **com.example.myapplication** and module name is **EntryAbility**, run the following command:

   ```shell
   hdc shell aa start -b com.example.myapplication -a EntryAbility
   ```

   For details, see [aa Commands](../tools/aa-tool.md).
