# Application Killed Detection

## Overview

An application crash refers to the unexpected exit of the application during use. When an application behaves abnormally, for example, consuming excessive system resources such as CPU and memory, the system kills the application based on rules to maintain its health status. Typically, the system kills the application by sending the **SIGKILL** signal (the signal value is **9**) to the application through the service process. By default, the OS does not generate maintenance and debugging information such as stack logs for the **SIGKILL** behavior. As a result, no log is generated in the faultLogger when the application crashes.

## Basic Concepts

An application exits in the following scenarios:

1. When an application is abnormal or throws an exception, for example, the **CPP_CRASH** exception triggered by **SIGSEGV** or **SIGABRT**, the system monitors the exception and record maintenance and debugging logs.

2. When a user manually terminates an application, for example, by clicking the clear button in the task list to clear all applications or swiping up to clear an application, no stack or other maintenance and debugging logs are generated.

3. When **exit** is called, maintenance and debugging logs such as stack logs are not generated.

4. When the application main thread is blocked, the UI freezes and the **APP_FREEZE** log is generated.

5. When resources are overused, the system kills the process and provides detailed maintenance and debugging information. For example, when memory leaks occur in an application, the corresponding maintenance and debugging logs are generated. You can subscribe to **RESOURCE_OVERLIMIT** through **HiAppEvent** to obtain the information.

6. When the system kills the process under conditions such as **LowMemoryKiller**, RSS exceeding 4 GB, or rapid memory leaks, it produces no detailed maintenance or debugging informationâ€”specifically, no **RESOURCE_OVERLIMIT** log is generated.

This topic describes the killing caused by the **SIGKILL** signal in scenarios 5 and 6.

## Implementation Principles

1. Both the kernel and service processes monitor system resources.

2. If an exception is detected, the application is killed.

3. The system adds system event logging when triggering application killing.

4. The logging information includes the UID, bundle name, foreground and background information, killing reason, and maintenance and debugging information.

## Constraints

1. The application needs to subscribe to the killing event through HiAppEvent.

2. The killing event is asynchronously released to the application. The application can receive the event only when it is started next time.

3. The killing behavior of the system is subject to versions. Therefore, the current killing mechanism may be incomplete.

## Triggering Scenario

The system may kill applications in the following scenarios:

1. The memory, CPU, and I/O load of the application exceeds the specified limit, and the number of file handles and threads exceeds the threshold.

2. When the device memory is low, applications are killed based on the memory usage and priority.

3. Power-consuming scenarios include frequent wake-ups caused by Binder calls, system freezes during audio playback or recording, and abnormal use of peripherals such as GPS or Bluetooth.

## Detection Methods

Applications can detect abnormal killing in either of the following ways:

1. Obtain the killing reason from the **onCreate** callback parameter of the ability. Specifically, set the **LastExitReason** parameter in **LaunchParam**. For details, see [LastExitReason](../reference/apis-ability-kit/js-apis-app-ability-abilityConstant.md).

2. Subscribe to the **APP_KILLED** event through HiAppEvent. For details, see [HiAppEvent](hiappevent-watcher-app-killed-events.md).

## Analysis Method and Procedure

1. Obtain the killing reason from the **onCreate** callback parameter of the ability.

    For details, see the following table.

    | APP_FREEZE           | APP_FREEZE               | The application exits because watchdog detects that the application is frozen.| Subscribe to the **APP_FREEZE** event through HiAppEvent and match its fault types.|

    | RESOURCE_CONTROL     | Memory Pressure          | The system memory is low, triggering application killing in ascending order of priority.                | Reduce the memory usage of the application.|

2. Subscribe to the **APP_KILLED** event through HiAppEvent.

    Based on the **APP_KILLED** event, you can obtain key information such as the killing cause and application foreground and background. Perform operations based on the following table.
