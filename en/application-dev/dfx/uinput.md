### Querying Mouse Pointer Information
Queries the current mouse pointer information.

When the mouse pointer is visible, the mouse pointer status and [style](../reference/apis-input-kit/js-apis-pointer.md#pointerstyle) are displayed. If the **filePath** parameter is passed in and the mouse pointer is a third-party custom pointer (the enumerated value of the style is **-100**), the mouse pointer style image is saved in binary format to the specified file. You need to create the **filePath** file. If the **filePath** parameter is not passed in, the style image is not saved. When the mouse pointer is not visible, the style information is not displayed, and the style image is not saved.

**Command**
```bash
uinput -M -q [filePath]

# [filePath] specifies the path for saving the pointer style image file. This parameter is optional. The current version supports only the file save path in the /data/local/tmp/ directory, for example, /data/local/tmp/testfile.
```

**Example**
```bash
# Query the visible status and style ID of the current mouse pointer.
uinput -M -q

# Query the visible status and style ID of the current mouse pointer, and write the mouse pointer style image in binary format to the /data/local/tmp/testfile file.
touch /data/local/tmp/testfile
uinput -M -q /data/local/tmp/testfile
```

**Command**
```bash
uinput -K -l <keyCode> [long press time]
uinput --keyboard --long_press <keyCode> [long press time]

# [long press time] specifies the long press duration, in milliseconds. The default value is 3000. The value must be an integer between 3000 and 15000. This parameter is optional.

For details about **keyCode**, see [@ohos.multimodalInput.keyCode (Keycode)](../reference/apis-input-kit/js-apis-keycode.md).

**Command**
```bash
uinput -K -r <keyCode> [repeat output time]
uinput --keyboard --repeat <keyCode> [repeat output time]

For details, see [@ohos.multimodalInput.keyCode (Keycode)](../reference/apis-input-kit/js-apis-keycode.md).

### Enabling the Capability of Controlling the Injected Modifier Key Status

You can enable the capability of controlling the injected modifier key status and set the duration. This command must be used together with the key down event. After the capability of controlling the injected modifier key status is enabled, you can specify the duration of the key down event. After the duration ends, the key up event is automatically triggered.

**Command**
```bash
uinput enable_key_status <enable> [duration]

# <enable> specifies whether to enable the capability of controlling the injected modifier key status. The value can be 1 or 0. The value 1 means to enable the capability, and 0 means the opposite.
# [duration] specifies the duration of the injected modifier key status, in seconds. The default value is 10. The value must be an integer ranging from [1,10].
```

**Example**
```bash
# Enable the capability of controlling the injected modifier key status and do not set the duration of the injected modifier key status. The injected **KEYCODE_SHIFT_LEFT** key (value: **2047**) press event can be maintained for 10s.
uinput enable_key_status 1
uinput -K -d 2047

# Enable the capability of controlling the injected modifier key status and set the duration of the injected modifier key status to 5s. The injected **KEYCODE_SHIFT_LEFT** key (value: **2047**) press event can be maintained for 5s.
uinput enable_key_status 1 5
uinput -K -d 2047
```

### Disabling the Capability of Controlling the Injected Modifier Key Status

Disable the capability of controlling the injected modifier key status. The capability can be enabled again next time.

**Command**
```bash
# <enable> specifies whether to enable the capability of controlling the injected modifier key status. The value can be 1 or 0. The value 1 means to enable the capability, and 0 means the opposite.
uinput enable_key_status <enable>
```

**Example**
```bash
# Disable the capability of controlling the injected modifier key status.
uinput enable_key_status 0
```

Simulates a two-knuckle double-tap on the touchscreen.

**Command**
```bash
uinput -T -k -d <dx1> <dy1> <dx2> <dy2> [interval time]
uinput --touch --knuckle --double <dx1> <dy1> <dx2> <dy2> [interval time]

# <dx1> and <dy1> are coordinates of the first knuckle in the relative coordinate system with the upper left corner of the screen as the origin.
# <dx2> and <dy2> are coordinates of the second knuckle in the relative coordinate system with the upper left corner of the screen as the origin.
# [interval time] specifies the interval, in milliseconds. The value must be an integer between 1 and 250. The default value is 200. This parameter is optional.
```

**Example**
```bash
# Simulate a two-knuckle double-tap at (100, 100) and (100, 130) at an interval of 200 ms.
uinput -T -k -d 100 100 100 130
```

## Touchpad Events

### Touchpad Pinch Event
Simulates a finger pinch on the touchpad.

**Command**
```bash
uinput -P -p <dx> <dy> scalePercent
uinput --touchpad --pinch <dx> <dy> scalePercent

# <dx> and <dy> are coordinates in the relative coordinate system with the upper-left corner of the screen as the origin.
# scalePercent specifies the scale percent. The value range is [1, 500]. If the value is less than 100, the image is zoomed out. If the value is greater than 100, the image is zoomed in. The value of dx must be greater than 0, and the value of dy must be greater than or equal to 200. In this scenario, only image zooming is supported. Ensure that there is an image on the screen when this command is executed.
```

**Example**
```bash
# Simulate a finger pinch on the touchpad.
uinput -P -p 100 300 89
```

### Touchpad Swipe Event
Simulates a swipe on the touchpad.

**Command**
```bash
uinput -P -s <startX> <startY> <endX> <endY>
uinput --touchpad --swipe <startX> <startY> <endX> <endY>

# <startX> and <startY> are coordinates of the start point of the touchpad swipe event in the relative coordinate system with the upper left corner of the screen as the origin.
# <endX> and <endY> are coordinates of the end point of the touchpad swipe event in the relative coordinate system with the upper left corner of the screen as the origin.
```

**Example**
```bash
# Simulate the three-finger swipe gesture on the touchpad.
uinput -P -s 100 1100 100 300
```

### Touchpad Rotate Event
Simulates a rotation on the touchpad.

Currently, the touchpad rotate event does not take effect.

**Command**
```bash
uinput -P -r <rotateValue>
uinput --touchpad --rotate <rotateValue>

# <rotateValue> specifies the rotation value, in degrees. The value must be an integer between –359 and 359. A positive value indicates clockwise rotation, and a negative value indicates counterclockwise rotation.
```

**Example**
```bash
# Simulate a two-finger rotation of 180 degrees on the touchpad.
uinput -P -r 180
```
