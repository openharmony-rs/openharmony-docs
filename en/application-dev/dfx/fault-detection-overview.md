# Overview

Performance Analysis Kit provides comprehensive capabilities such as fault detection and exception handling. As faults vary in causes and symptoms, application stability deteriorates, affecting application development efficiency, delivery costs, and user experience. Therefore, you need to improve quality by designing a fault management system, which includes the detection, analysis, locating and rectification of faults, and quality measurement.

To help developers quickly locate and rectify application faults, this section describes the detection principles, log specifications, log obtaining methods, and restrictions of faults such as process crash, address out-of-bounds, application freeze, resource leak, task execution timeout, and application killed.
