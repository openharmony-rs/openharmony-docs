This document describes how to use the HiTraceMeter APIs. You can call them to log traces, and then use [HiTrace](hitrace.md) or the trace collection API provided by [hidebug](../reference/apis-performance-analysis-kit/js-apis-hidebug.md#hidebugstartapptracecapture12) to obtain the trace information generated during program running. In this way, you can learn about the program running process, thread, timestamp, and CPU information for performance profiling and optimization.


HitraceMeter provides ArkTs and C/C++ APIs. You can select the APIs as required.

## Implementation Principles

The kernel sets a buffer to record the logs generated during device running and provides the **trace_marker** and **trace** nodes in sysfs.

The trace_marker node is a write-only node. After the program writes the logs to the trace_marker node, the logs are stored in the kernel buffer. The APIs provided by HiTraceMeter encapsulate the write operation. Applications can call these APIs to write trace data to the kernel node.

The trace node is a read-only node. You can read all records in the current buffer of the system from the trace node. The hitrace command line tool encapsulates the read operation on the node. You can use commands to display the collected trace points in the command line or save the trace points to the device file.

For the format of logging information generated by calling the HitraceMeter API, see [User-Mode Trace Format](hitracemeter-view.md#user-mode-trace-format).

**HiTraceMeter Tag**: trace data usage category. Each software subsystem corresponds to a tag. You can run the hitrace -l command in the HDC CLI to view all tag names and their brief introduction. When using the [hitrace](hitrace.md) command line tool to collect trace data, you need to specify a tag. The collection result contains only the trace data of the specified tag category. To call HiTraceMeter in an application, use the **app** tag.
