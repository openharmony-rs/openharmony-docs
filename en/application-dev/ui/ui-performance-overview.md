Optimizing application performance is crucial for enhancing user experience. When performance issues are detected, the analysis can generally follow these steps:
1. Reproduce the issue: Obtain the scenarios and reproduction steps by contacting users for feedback or adding performance instrumentation within the application.
2. Identify performance bottlenecks with tools: After reproducing the issue, the CPU Profiler tool in DevEco Studio can be used to capture traces during the issue. These traces help pinpoint bottlenecks for targeted optimization.
3. Determine solutions: Once bottlenecks are identified, you can use ArkTS CallStack information in the trace or review related service code to locate the implementation causing the bottleneck. Core optimization strategies can then be applied to the problematic code.
4. Verify results: After optimizing the code, reproduce the issue scenario again to verify the effect. Use the CPU Profiler to capture traces and confirm that the modification resolves the problem as expected.

## Core Strategies for UI Performance Optimization

### Tool-Driven Optimization
Using data rather than intuition to guide optimizations is key to efficiency. DevEco Studio provides two performance analysis tools for UI performance evaluation, helping locate performance issues effectively:
1. CPU Profiler: captures traces and call stacks during runtime to analyze bottlenecks. For details about the usage instructions, see <!--RP1-->[CPU Profiler](../performance/application-performance-analysis.md)<!--RP1End-->. For details about the trace interpretation, see <!--RP2-->[Typical Traces](../performance/common-trace-using-instructions.md)<!--RP2End-->.
2. ArkUI Inspector: visualizes the UI component tree and analyzes layout hierarchy and parameters. For details about the usage instructions, see <!--RP3-->ArkUI Inspector<!--RP3End-->.
When analyzing performance issues, first identify bottlenecks with the CPU Profiler, and then optimize in a targeted manner.

### Lazy Loading Prioritization
Deferring resource consumption in non-visible areas can significantly speed up application startup and page transitions. ArkUI provides the [LazyForEach](rendering-control/arkts-rendering-control-lazyforeach.md) component to facilitate lazy data loading in applications.

### Layout Computation Simplification
UI layout is a critical part of user interaction. More complex or nested layouts increase the time required for view creation, layout, and rendering. Reducing nesting levels or using high-performance layout nodes can minimize frame drops and stuttering. For guidance, see <!--RP4-->[Improving Layout Performance](../performance/reduce-view-nesting-levels.md)<!--RP4End-->.

### Update Instead of Rebuild
Components that are used repeatedly can be cached, and updates can replace rebuilding to improve performance. For example, in a scrollable container, components leaving the visible area are released while new components entering the visible area are created. Repeatedly releasing and creating the same **ListItem** is redundant. For such scenarios requiring caching and reuse, ArkUI provides [component reuse](state-management/arkts-reusable.md). Custom components can be marked for reuse, added to a reuse pool upon release, and later retrieved to be updated instead of re-created. For details about the application scenarios, see <!--RP5-->Component Reuse Principles and Tips<!--RP5End-->.

### Precise State Control
[State management](state-management/arkts-state-management-overview.md) is the core declarative mechanism in ArkUI, linking data with the UI. During UI refresh, state management logic is executed repeatedly. The creation of state variables and their binding to UI components is crucial for refresh efficiency. As such, [use state management properly](state-management/properly-use-state-management-to-develope.md) based on actual scenarios and follow [state management best practices](state-management/arkts-state-management-best-practices.md).
