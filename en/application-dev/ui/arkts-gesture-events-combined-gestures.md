A combined gesture is a combination of multiple single gestures. Its recognition mode is subject to [GestureMode](../reference/apis-arkui/arkui-ts/ts-combined-gestures.md#gesturemode) passed in [GestureGroup](../reference/apis-arkui/arkui-ts/ts-combined-gestures.md#apis). Three recognition modes are supported: [sequential recognition](#sequential-recognition), [parallel recognition](#parallel-recognition), and [exclusive recognition](#exclusive-recognition).

```ts
GestureGroup(mode:GestureMode, gesture:GestureType[])
```


- **mode**: recognition mode of combined gestures. The value belongs to the **GestureMode** enumeration class.

- **gesture**: array of multiple gestures.  .


## Sequential Recognition

For sequential recognition, the value of **GestureMode** is **Sequence**. In this gesture recognition mode, gestures are recognized in the order in which they were registered until they are all recognized successfully. If any of the registered gestures fails to be recognized, subsequent gestures will also fail. Only the last gesture recognized responds to the [onActionEnd](../reference/apis-arkui/arkui-ts/ts-gesturehandler.md#onactionend) event.

In the following example, the combined gestures for continuous recognition are the long press gesture and pan gesture.

The [translate](../reference/apis-arkui/arkui-ts/ts-universal-attributes-transformation.md#translate) attribute is bound to a **Column** component. You can set the attribute to translate the component. Then, bind [LongPressGesture](../reference/apis-arkui/arkui-ts/ts-basic-gestures-longpressgesture.md) and [PanGesture](../reference/apis-arkui/arkui-ts/ts-basic-gestures-pangesture.md) to the component in the **Sequence** recognition mode. When a long press gesture is recognized, the displayed number is updated. When the user drags the component after the long press gesture, the component is dragged based on the callback function of the pan gesture.

>**NOTE**
>
>The drag event is a typical use case of sequential recognition on the long press gesture and pan gesture. It is triggered only when the user performs a pan gesture within the preset time frame after a long press gesture is recognized. If the long press gesture is not recognized or the pan gesture is not performed within the preset time frame, the drag event will not be triggered.


## Parallel Recognition

For parallel recognition, the value of **GestureMode** is **Parallel**. In this gesture recognition mode, gestures registered in the combined gestures will be recognized at the same time until they are all recognized successfully. The gestures are recognized in parallel without affecting each other.

For example, if the tap gesture and the double-tap gesture are bound to the **Column** component in parallel recognition mode, they can be recognized at the same time, and the recognition of these two gestures does not interfere with each other. 

  <!-- @[parallel_recognition](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/ArkUISample/GestureGroup/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Parallel.ets) -->
  
  ``` TypeScript
  // xxx.ets
  @Entry
  @Component
  struct parallelRecognition {
    @State count1: number = 0;
    @State count2: number = 0;
  
    build() {
      Column() {
        Text('Parallel gesture\n' + 'tapGesture count is 1:' + this.count1 + '\ntapGesture count is 2:' + this.count2 + '\n')
          .fontSize(28);
      }
      .height(200)
      .width('100%')
      // The following combined gestures are recognized in parallel mode. After a tap gesture is recognized successfully, if another tap gesture is recognized within the specified time frame, a double-tap gesture will also be recognized.
      .gesture(
        GestureGroup(GestureMode.Parallel,
          TapGesture({ count: 1 })
            .onAction(() => {
              this.count1++;
            }),
          TapGesture({ count: 2 })
            .onAction(() => {
              this.count2++;
            })
        )
      )
    }
  }
  ```

>**NOTE**
>
> - After a tap gesture and a double-tap gesture are combined for parallel recognition, when taps are performed in an area, the tap gesture and the double-tap gesture are recognized at the same time.
>
> - When there is only a single tap, the tap gesture is recognized, but the double-tap gesture fails to be recognized.
>
> - When there are two taps and the interval between the two taps is within a specified period (300 ms by default), two tap events and one double-tap event are triggered.
>
> - When there are two taps, but the interval between the two taps exceeds the specified time, two tap events are triggered but the double-tap event is not triggered.


## Exclusive Recognition

For exclusive recognition, the value of **GestureMode** is **Exclusive**. In this gesture recognition mode, all registered gestures are recognized at once. Once any of the gestures is recognized successfully, the gesture recognition ends, and all other gestures fail to be recognized.

For example, when both the tap gesture and double-tap gesture are bound to a **Column** component in exclusive recognition mode, the order in which these gestures are bound matters. If you bind the tap gesture before the double-tap, the double-tap gesture won't be recognized because the tap consumes all touch events. Conversely, if you bind the double-tap gesture first, it will be recognized without being intercepted by the tap gesture.

  ``` TypeScript

  struct MutualExclusion {
    @State count1: number = 0;
    @State count2: number = 0;
  
    build() {
      Column() {
        Text('Exclusive gesture\n' + 'tapGesture count is 1:' + this.count1 + '\ntapGesture count is 2:' + this.count2 + '\n')
          .fontSize(28)
      }
      .height(200)
      .width('100%')
      // The following combined gestures are mutually exclusive. After the tap gesture is recognized successfully, the double-tap gesture fails to be recognized.
      .gesture(
        GestureGroup(GestureMode.Exclusive,
          TapGesture({ count: 1 })
            .onAction(() => {
              this.count1++;
            }),
          TapGesture({ count: 2 })
            .onAction(() => {
              this.count2++;
            })
        )
      )
    }
  }
  ```

>
> - When there is only a single tap, the tap gesture is recognized, but the double-tap gesture fails to be recognized.
>
> - When there are two taps, the gesture response depends on the order of gesture binding. If you bind the tap gesture first, followed by the double-tap gesture, the tap gesture will be recognized on the first tap, causing the double-tap gesture to fail. Even if the second tap is performed within the specified time, the double-tap gesture event is not responded to. Instead, another tap gesture event is triggered. Conversely, if you bind the double-tap gesture first, it will be recognized without triggering the tap gesture.

## Example Scenario

The following example implements a child component bound to both a long press gesture and a pan gesture. These two gestures can trigger in parallel, but when the long press gesture is not successfully recognized, the built‑in pan gesture of the parent **Swiper** component should take effect. Because the child's pan gesture competes with the parent's built‑in pan gesture and has higher priority, dynamic control is required to decide whether the child's pan gesture should be triggered.

          .borderRadius(12)
          // Use a custom gesture judgment callback to reject the child's pan gesture when the long press gesture fails, allowing the parent Swiper component's swipe gesture to succeed.
          .onGestureRecognizerJudgeBegin(
            (event: BaseGestureEvent, current: GestureRecognizer, others: Array<GestureRecognizer>)=>{
            if (current.getType() !== GestureControl.GestureType.PAN_GESTURE) {
              return GestureJudgeResult.CONTINUE;
            };
            if (this.isLongPress) {
