# File Organization

## Directory Structure

The following figure shows the typical directory structure of the JavaScript module \(**entry/src/main/js/module**\) for an application with feature abilities \(FA\) using JavaScript APIs.

**Figure 2** Directory structure for resource sharing<sup>5+</sup>  

![directory-structure-for-resource-sharing-5+](figures/directory-structure-for-resource-sharing-5+.png)

Functions of the files are as follows:

-   .hml  files describe the page layout.
-   .css  files describe the page style.
-   .js  files process the page logic and user interactions .

Functions of the folders are as follows:

-   The **app.js** file manages global JavaScript logics and application lifecycle. For details, see [app.js](js-framework-js-file.md).
-   The **pages** directory stores all component pages.
-   The **common** directory stores public resource files, such as media resources, custom components,  and  .js  files.
-   The **resources** directory stores resource configuration files, for example, for multi-resolution loading. For details, see [Resource Limitations and Access](js-framework-resource-restriction.md).
-   The **share** directory<sup>5+</sup>  is used to configure resources shared by multiple instances. For example, images and JSON files in this directory can be shared by **default1** and **default2** instances.

>**NOTE** 
>
>-   The **i18n** and **resources** folders cannot be renamed.
>-   If the same resource name and directory are used under the  share  directory and the instance \(**default**\) directory, the resource in the instance directory will be used when you reference the directory.
>-   The **share** directory does not support **i18n**.
>-   You should create the optional folders \(shown in the directory structure\) as needed after you create the project in DevEco Studio.

## File Access Rules

Application resources can be accessed via an absolute or relative path. In the JS UI framework, an absolute path starts with a slash \(/\), and a relative path starts with  ./  or  ../. The rules are as follows:

-   To reference a code file, use a relative path, for example, **../common/utils.js**.
-   To reference a resource file, use an absolute path, for example, **/common/xxx.png**.
-   Store code files and resource files in the **common** directory and access the files in a required fashion.
-   In a  .css  file, use the  url\(\)  function to create a URL, for example, **url\(/common/xxx.png\)**.

>**NOTE** 
>
>When code file A needs to reference code file B:
>
>-   If code files A and B are in the same directory, you can use either a relative or absolute path in code file B to reference resource files.
>-   If code files A and B are in different directories, you must use an absolute path in code file B to reference resource files because the directory of code file B changes during Webpack packaging.
>-   Use an absolute path if you want to dynamically change the resource file path through data binding in a  .js  file.
