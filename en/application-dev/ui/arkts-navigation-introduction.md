# Component Navigation and Page Routing Overview

The **Navigation** component and the APIs in the **Router** (@ohos.router) module both facilitate page redirection within an application. Yet, the **Navigation** component excels by offering intra-component redirection, which is particularly beneficial in one-time development for multi-device deployment. It provides more flexible page stack operations and a wider range of animations and lifecycles. Therefore, to deliver a better user experience, use the **Navigation** component to implement page redirection and intra-component redirection whenever possible.

## Architecture Differences

In the ArkUI component tree hierarchy, pages that were originally managed by the **Router** module are located beneath the stage management node of the page stack. **Navigation**, as a navigation container component, can be mounted under a single page node and can also be stacked and nested. **Navigation** manages the title bar, toolbar, and content area, an area designed to display the content of custom pages and allowing for page routing. The design of **Navigation** has the following advantages:

![image](figures/navigation-and-router-architecture.png)

1. Explicitly distinguishes the title bar, content area, and toolbar in the API for enhanced management and UX animation flexibility.

2. Explicitly provides a routing container, allowing you to decide its location, which can be in a modal, sheet, or dialog box.

3. Integrates UX design and one-time development for multi-device deployment capabilities, with default capabilities for unified title display, page switching, and single or double column adaptation.

4. Enables flexible page configuration by allowing you to determine the relationship between page aliases and UI through [UIBuilder](../ui/state-management/arkts-builder.md).

5. Transforms page transition animations into component property animations, offering a wider and more flexible range of transition effects.

6. Provides an inheritable page stack object for improved page display management.
