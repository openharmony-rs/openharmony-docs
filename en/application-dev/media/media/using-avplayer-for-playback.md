# Using AVPlayer to Play Audio (ArkTS)

The [AVPlayer](media-kit-intro.md#avplayer) is used to play raw media assets in an end-to-end manner. In this topic, you will learn how to use the AVPlayer to play a complete piece of music. To play PCM audio data, call [AudioRenderer](../audio/using-audiorenderer-for-playback.md).

The full playback process includes creating an AVPlayer instance, setting the media asset to play, setting playback parameters (volume, speed, and focus mode), controlling playback (play, pause, seek, and stop), resetting the playback configuration, and releasing the instance.


During application development, you can use the **state** property of the AVPlayer to obtain the AVPlayer state or call **on('stateChange')** to listen for state changes. If the application performs an operation when the AVPlayer is not in the given state, the system may throw an exception or generate other undefined behavior.

For details about the states, see [AVPlayerState](../../reference/apis-media-kit/arkts-apis-media-t.md#avplayerstate9). When the AVPlayer is in the **prepared**, **playing**, **paused**, or **completed** state, the playback engine is working and a large amount of RAM is occupied. If your application does not need to use the AVPlayer, call **reset()** or **release()** to release the instance.

## Developer's Tips

This topic describes only how to implement the playback of a media asset. In practice, background playback and playback conflicts may be involved. You can refer to the following description to handle the situation based on your service requirements.

- If you want the application to continue playing the media asset in the background or when the screen is off, use the [AVSession](../avsession/avsession-access-scene.md) and [continuous task](../../task-management/continuous-task.md) to prevent the playback from being forcibly interrupted by the system.
- If the media asset being played involves audio, the playback may be interrupted by other applications based on the system audio management policy. (For details, see [Processing Audio Interruption Events](../audio/audio-playback-concurrency.md).) It is recommended that the player application proactively listen for audio interruption events and handle the events accordingly to avoid the inconsistency between the application status and the expected effect.
- When a device is connected to multiple audio output devices, the application can listen for audio output device changes through [on('audioOutputDeviceChangeWithInfo')](../../reference/apis-media-kit/arkts-apis-media-AVPlayer.md#onaudiooutputdevicechangewithinfo11) and perform the processing accordingly.
- To access online media resources, you must request the ohos.permission.INTERNET permission.

## How to Develop

Read [AVPlayer](../../reference/apis-media-kit/arkts-apis-media-AVPlayer.md) for the API reference.

1. Call **createAVPlayer()** to create an AVPlayer instance. The AVPlayer is the **idle** state.

2. Set the events to listen for, which will be used in the full-process scenario. The table below lists the supported events.

   | Event Type| Description|
   | -------- | -------- |
   | stateChange | Mandatory; used to listen for changes of the **state** property of the AVPlayer.|
   | error | Mandatory; used to listen for AVPlayer errors.|
   | durationUpdate | Used to listen for progress bar updates to refresh the media asset duration.|
   | timeUpdate | Used to listen for the current position of the progress bar to refresh the current time.|
   | seekDone | Used to listen for the completion status of the **seek()** request.<br>This event is reported when the AVPlayer seeks to the playback position specified in **seek()**.|
   | speedDone | Used to listen for the completion status of the **setSpeed()** request.<br>This event is reported when the AVPlayer plays music at the speed specified in **setSpeed()**.|
   | volumeChange | Used to listen for the completion status of the **setVolume()** request.<br>This event is reported when the AVPlayer plays music at the volume specified in **setVolume()**.|
   | bufferingUpdate | Used to listen for network playback buffer information. This event reports the buffer percentage and playback progress.|
   | audioInterrupt | Used to listen for audio interruption. This event is used together with the **audioInterruptMode** property.<br>This event is reported when the current audio playback is interrupted by another (for example, when a call is coming), so the application can process the event in time.|

3. Set the media asset URL. The AVPlayer enters the **initialized** state.
   > **NOTE**
   >
   > The URL in the code snippet below is for reference only. You need to check the media asset validity and set the URL based on service requirements.
   > 
   > - If local files are used for playback, ensure that the files are available and the application sandbox path is used for access. For details about how to obtain the application sandbox path, see [Obtaining Application File Paths](../../application-models/application-context-stage.md#obtaining-application-file-paths). For details about the application sandbox and how to push files to the application sandbox directory, see [File Management](../../file-management/app-sandbox-directory.md).
   > 
   > - If a network playback path is used, you must [declare the ohos.permission.INTERNET permission](../../security/AccessToken/declare-permissions.md).
   > 
   > - You can also use **ResourceManager.getRawFd** to obtain the FD of a file packed in the HAP file. For details, see [ResourceManager API Reference](../../reference/apis-localization-kit/js-apis-resource-manager.md#getrawfd9).
   > 
   > - The [playback formats and protocols](media-kit-intro.md#supported-formats-and-protocols) in use must be those supported by the system.
   > 
   > In addition, the audio renderer information (if required) must be set only when the AVPlayer is in the initialized state, that is, before **prepare()** is called for the first time. If the media source contains videos, the default value of **usage** is **STREAM_USAGE_MOVIE**. Otherwise, the default value of **usage** is **STREAM_USAGE_MUSIC**. The default value of **rendererFlags** is 0. To ensure that the audio behavior meets the expectation, you are advised to proactively configure [audio.AudioRendererInfo](../../reference/apis-audio-kit/arkts-apis-audio-i.md#audiorendererinfo8) and select a proper stream type (specified by [usage](../../media/audio/using-right-streamusage-and-sourcetype.md)) based on your service scenario and requirements.

4. Call **prepare()** to switch the AVPlayer to the **prepared** state. In this state, you can obtain the duration of the media asset to play and set the volume.

5. Call **play()**, **pause()**, **seek()**, and **stop()** to perform audio playback control as required.

6. (Optional) Call **reset()** to reset the AVPlayer. The AVPlayer enters the **idle** state again and you can change the media asset URL.

7. Call **release()** to switch the AVPlayer to the **released** state. Now your application exits the playback.

## Running the Sample Project

Refer to the sample code below to play a complete piece of music. In this example, 3 seconds after the playback starts, the playback is paused for 3 seconds and then resumed.

1. Create a project, download the [sample project](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/tree/master/code/DocsSample/Media/AVPlayer/AVPlayerArkTSAudio), and copy its resources to the corresponding directories.
    ```
