# Using AudioRenderer for Audio Playback

The AudioRenderer is used to play Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) audio data. Unlike the [AVPlayer](../media/using-avplayer-for-playback.md), the AudioRenderer can perform data preprocessing before audio input. Therefore, the AudioRenderer is more suitable if you have extensive audio development experience and want to implement more flexible playback features.

## Development Guidelines

The full rendering process involves creating an AudioRenderer instance, configuring audio rendering parameters, starting and stopping rendering, and releasing the instance. In this topic, you will learn how to use the AudioRenderer to render audio data. Before the development, you are advised to read [AudioRenderer](../../reference/apis-audio-kit/js-apis-audio.md#audiorenderer8) for the API reference.

The figure below shows the state changes of the AudioRenderer. After an AudioRenderer instance is created, different APIs can be called to switch the AudioRenderer to different states and trigger the required behavior. If an API is called when the AudioRenderer is not in the given state, the system may throw an exception or generate other undefined behavior. Therefore, you are advised to check the AudioRenderer state before triggering state transition.

To prevent the UI thread from being blocked, most AudioRenderer calls are asynchronous. Each API provides the callback and promise functions. The following examples use the callback functions.

**Figure 1** AudioRenderer state transition

During application development, you are advised to use [on('stateChange')](../../reference/apis-audio-kit/js-apis-audio.md#onstatechange8) to subscribe to state changes of the AudioRenderer. This is because some operations can be performed only when the AudioRenderer is in a given state. If the application performs an operation when the AudioRenderer is not in the given state, the system may throw an exception or generate other undefined behavior.

- **prepared**: The AudioRenderer enters this state by calling [createAudioRenderer()](../../reference/apis-audio-kit/js-apis-audio.md#audiocreateaudiorenderer8).

- **running**: The AudioRenderer enters this state by calling [start()](../../reference/apis-audio-kit/js-apis-audio.md#start8) when it is in the **prepared**, **paused**, or **stopped** state.

- **paused**: The AudioRenderer enters this state by calling [pause()](../../reference/apis-audio-kit/js-apis-audio.md#pause8) when it is in the **running** state. When the audio playback is paused, it can call [start()](../../reference/apis-audio-kit/js-apis-audio.md#start8) to resume the playback.

- **stopped**: The AudioRenderer enters this state by calling [stop()](../../reference/apis-audio-kit/js-apis-audio.md#stop8) when it is in the **paused** or **running** state.

- **released**: The AudioRenderer enters this state by calling [release()](../../reference/apis-audio-kit/js-apis-audio.md#release8) when it is in the **prepared**, **paused**, or **stopped** state. In this state, the AudioRenderer releases all occupied hardware and software resources and will not transit to any other state.

### How to Develop

1. Set audio rendering parameters and create an AudioRenderer instance. For details about the parameters, see [AudioRendererOptions](../../reference/apis-audio-kit/js-apis-audio.md#audiorendereroptions8).

    ```ts
    import { audio } from '@kit.AudioKit';

    let audioStreamInfo: audio.AudioStreamInfo = {
      samplingRate: audio.AudioSamplingRate.SAMPLE_RATE_48000, // Sampling rate.
      channels: audio.AudioChannel.CHANNEL_2, // Channel.
      sampleFormat: audio.AudioSampleFormat.SAMPLE_FORMAT_S16LE, // Sampling format.
      encodingType: audio.AudioEncodingType.ENCODING_TYPE_RAW // Encoding format.
    };

    let audioRendererInfo: audio.AudioRendererInfo = {
      usage: audio.StreamUsage.STREAM_USAGE_MUSIC, // Audio stream usage type: music. Set this parameter based on the service scenario.
      rendererFlags: 0 // AudioRenderer flag.
    };

    let audioRendererOptions: audio.AudioRendererOptions = {
      streamInfo: audioStreamInfo,
      rendererInfo: audioRendererInfo
    };

    audio.createAudioRenderer(audioRendererOptions, (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(`Invoke createAudioRenderer failed, code is ${err.code}, message is ${err.message}`);
        return;
      } else {
        console.info('Invoke createAudioRenderer succeeded.');
        let audioRenderer = data;
      }
    });
    ```

2. Call **on('writeData')** to subscribe to the callback for audio data writing. You are advised to use this function in API version 12, since it returns a callback result.

   - From API version 12, this function returns a callback result, enabling the system to determine whether to play the data in the callback based on the value returned.

     > **NOTE**
     > 
     > - When the amount of data is sufficient to meet the required buffer length of the callback, you should return **audio.AudioDataCallbackResult.VALID**, and the system uses the entire data buffer for playback. Do not return **audio.AudioDataCallbackResult.VALID** in this case, as this leads to audio artifacts such as noise and playback stuttering.
     > 
     > - When the amount of data is insufficient to meet the required buffer length of the callback, you are advised to return **audio.AudioDataCallbackResult.INVALID**. In this case, the system does not process this portion of audio data but requests data from the application again. Once the buffer is adequately filled, you can return **audio.AudioDataCallbackResult.VALID**.
     > 
     > - Once the callback function finishes its execution, the audio service queues the data in the buffer for playback. Therefore, do not change the buffered data outside the callback. Regarding the last frame, if there is insufficient data to completely fill the buffer, you must concatenate the available data with padding to ensure that the buffer is full. This prevents any residual dirty data in the buffer from adversely affecting the playback effect.

     ```ts
     import { audio } from '@kit.AudioKit';
     import { BusinessError } from '@kit.BasicServicesKit';
     import { fileIo as fs } from '@kit.CoreFileKit';
     import { common } from '@kit.AbilityKit';

     class Options {
       offset?: number;
       length?: number;
     }

     let bufferSize: number = 0;
     // Obtain the context from the component and ensure that the return value of this.getUIContext().getHostContext() is UIAbilityContext.
     let context = this.getUIContext().getHostContext() as common.UIAbilityContext;
     let path = context.cacheDir;
     // Ensure that the resource exists in the path.
     let filePath = path + '/StarWars10s-2C-48000-4SW.pcm';
     let file: fs.File = fs.openSync(filePath, fs.OpenMode.READ_ONLY);

     let writeDataCallback = (buffer: ArrayBuffer) => {
       let options: Options = {
         offset: bufferSize,
         length: buffer.byteLength
       };

       try {
         fs.readSync(file.fd, buffer, options);
         bufferSize += buffer.byteLength;
         // The system determines that the buffer is valid and plays the data normally.
         return audio.AudioDataCallbackResult.VALID;
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Error reading file:', error);
         // The system determines that the buffer is invalid and does not play the data.
         return audio.AudioDataCallbackResult.INVALID;
       }
     };

     audioRenderer.on('writeData', writeDataCallback);
     ```

   - In API version 11, this function does not return a callback result, and the system treats all data in the callback as valid by default.

     > **NOTE**
     > 
     > - Ensure that the callback's data buffer is completely filled to the necessary length to prevent issues such as audio noise and playback stuttering.
     > 
     > - If the amount of data is insufficient to fill the data buffer, you are advised to temporarily halt data writing (without pausing the audio stream), block the callback function, and wait until enough data accumulates before resuming writing, thereby ensuring that the buffer is fully filled. If you need to call AudioRenderer APIs after the callback function is blocked, unblock the callback function first.
     > 
     > - If you do not want to play the audio data in this callback function, you can nullify the data block in the callback function. (Once nullified, the system still regards this as part of the written data, leading to silent frames during playback).
     > 
     > - Once the callback function finishes its execution, the audio service queues the data in the buffer for playback. Therefore, do not change the buffered data outside the callback. Regarding the last frame, if there is insufficient data to completely fill the buffer, you must concatenate the available data with padding to ensure that the buffer is full. This prevents any residual dirty data in the buffer from adversely affecting the playback effect.

     ```ts
     import { BusinessError } from '@kit.BasicServicesKit';
     import { fileIo as fs } from '@kit.CoreFileKit';
     import { common } from '@kit.AbilityKit';

     class Options {
       offset?: number;
       length?: number;
     }

     let bufferSize: number = 0;
     // Obtain the context from the component and ensure that the return value of this.getUIContext().getHostContext() is UIAbilityContext.
     let context = this.getUIContext().getHostContext() as common.UIAbilityContext;
     let path = context.cacheDir;
     // Ensure that the resource exists in the path.
     let filePath = path + '/StarWars10s-2C-48000-4SW.pcm';
     let file: fs.File = fs.openSync(filePath, fs.OpenMode.READ_ONLY);
     let writeDataCallback = (buffer: ArrayBuffer) => {
       // If you do not want to play a particular portion of the buffer, you can add a check and clear that specific section of the buffer.
       let options: Options = {
         offset: bufferSize,
         length: buffer.byteLength
       };
       fs.readSync(file.fd, buffer, options);
       bufferSize += buffer.byteLength;
     };

     audioRenderer.on('writeData', writeDataCallback);
     ```

3. Call **start()** to switch the AudioRenderer to the **running** state and start rendering.

    ```ts
    import { BusinessError } from '@kit.BasicServicesKit';

    audioRenderer.start((err: BusinessError) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(`Renderer start failed, code is ${err.code}, message is ${err.message}`);
      } else {
        console.info('Renderer start success.');
      }
    });
    ```

4. Call **stop()** to stop rendering.

    ```ts
    import { BusinessError } from '@kit.BasicServicesKit';

    audioRenderer.stop((err: BusinessError) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(`Renderer stop failed, code is ${err.code}, message is ${err.message}`);
      } else {
        console.info('Renderer stopped.');
      }
    });
    ```

5. Call **release()** to release the instance.

    ```ts
    import { BusinessError } from '@kit.BasicServicesKit';

    audioRenderer.release((err: BusinessError) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(`Renderer release failed, code is ${err.code}, message is ${err.message}`);
      } else {
        console.info('Renderer released.');
      } 
    });
    ```

### Selecting the Correct Stream Usage

When developing a media player, it is important to correctly set the stream usage type according to the intended use case. This will ensure that the player behaves as expected in different scenarios.

The recommended use cases are described in [StreamUsage](../../reference/apis-audio-kit/js-apis-audio.md#streamusage). For example, **STREAM_USAGE_MUSIC** is recommended for music scenarios, **STREAM_USAGE_MOVIE** is recommended for movie or video scenarios, and **STREAM_USAGE_GAME** is recommended for gaming scenarios.

An incorrect configuration of **StreamUsage** may cause unexpected behavior. Example scenarios are as follows:

- When **STREAM_USAGE_MUSIC** is incorrectly used in a game scenario, the game cannot be played simultaneously with music applications. However, games usually can coexist with music playback.
- When **STREAM_USAGE_MUSIC** is incorrectly used in a navigation scenario, any playing music is interrupted when the navigation application provides audio guidance. However, it is generally expected that the music keeps playing at a lower volume while the navigation is active.

### Configuring the Appropriate Audio Sampling Rate

The sampling rate refers to the number of samples captured per second for a single audio channel, measured in Hz.

Resampling involves upsampling (adding samples through interpolation) or downsampling (removing samples through decimation) when there is a mismatch between the input and output audio sampling rates.

The AudioRenderer supports all sampling rates defined in the enum **AudioSamplingRate**.

If the input audio sampling rate configured by AudioRenderer is different from the output sampling rate of the device, the system resamples the input audio to match the output sampling rate.

To minimize power consumption from resampling, it is best to use input audio with a sampling rate that matches the output sampling rate of the device. A sampling rate of 48 kHz is highly recommended.

### Sample Code

Refer to the sample code below to render an audio file using AudioRenderer.

```ts
import { audio } from '@kit.AudioKit';
import { BusinessError } from '@kit.BasicServicesKit';
import { fileIo as fs } from '@kit.CoreFileKit';
import { common } from '@kit.AbilityKit';

const TAG = 'AudioRendererDemo';

class Options {
  offset?: number;
  length?: number;

  encodingType: audio.AudioEncodingType.ENCODING_TYPE_RAW // Encoding format.
};
let audioRendererInfo: audio.AudioRendererInfo = {
  usage: audio.StreamUsage.STREAM_USAGE_MUSIC, // Audio stream usage type: music. Set this parameter based on the service scenario.
  rendererFlags: 0 // AudioRenderer flag.
};
let audioRendererOptions: audio.AudioRendererOptions = {
  streamInfo: audioStreamInfo,
  rendererInfo: audioRendererInfo
};
// Obtain the context from the component and ensure that the return value of this.getUIContext().getHostContext() is UIAbilityContext.
let context = this.getUIContext().getHostContext() as common.UIAbilityContext;
let path = context.cacheDir;
// Ensure that the resource exists in the path.
let filePath = path + '/StarWars10s-2C-48000-4SW.pcm';
let file: fs.File = fs.openSync(filePath, fs.OpenMode.READ_ONLY);
let writeDataCallback = (buffer: ArrayBuffer) => {
  let options: Options = {
    offset: bufferSize,
    length: buffer.byteLength
  };

  try {
    fs.readSync(file.fd, buffer, options);
    bufferSize += buffer.byteLength;
    // This function does not return a callback result in API version 11, but does so in API version 12 and later versions.
    return audio.AudioDataCallbackResult.VALID;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error reading file:', error);
    // This function does not return a callback result in API version 11, but does so in API version 12 and later versions.
    return audio.AudioDataCallbackResult.INVALID;
  }
};

// Create an AudioRenderer instance, and set the events to listen for.
function init() {

    }
  });
}

// Start audio rendering.
function start() {
  if (renderModel !== undefined) {
    let stateGroup = [audio.AudioState.STATE_PREPARED, audio.AudioState.STATE_PAUSED, audio.AudioState.STATE_STOPPED];
    if (stateGroup.indexOf((renderModel as audio.AudioRenderer).state.valueOf()) === -1) { // Rendering can be started only when the AudioRenderer is in the prepared, paused, or stopped state.
      console.error(TAG + 'start failed');
      return;
    }
    // Start rendering.
    (renderModel as audio.AudioRenderer).start((err: BusinessError) => {

      return;
    }
    // Stop rendering.

      console.info('Renderer already released');
      return;
    }
    // Release the resources.
    (renderModel as audio.AudioRenderer).release((err: BusinessError) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error('Renderer release failed.');
      } else {
        console.info('Renderer release success.');
      }
    });
  }
}
```

When audio streams with the same or higher priority need to use the output device, the current audio playback will be interrupted. The application can respond to and handle the interruption event. For details, see [Processing Audio Interruption Events](audio-playback-concurrency.md).
