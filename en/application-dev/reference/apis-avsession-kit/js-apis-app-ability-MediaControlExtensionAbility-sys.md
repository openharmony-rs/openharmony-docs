# @ohos.app.ability.MediaControlExtensionAbility (ExtensionAbility for Media Playback Control) (System API)

The MediaControlExtensionAbility module provides extended capabilities for media playback control. It inherits from [UIExtensionAbility](../apis-ability-kit/js-apis-app-ability-uiExtensionAbility.md) and does not introduce any additional interfaces. During actual development, you need to implement the APIs in the parent class to use the lifecycle and capabilities of UIExtensionAbilities. You cannot directly call the base class.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.Multimedia.AVSession.Core

> **NOTE**
>
> - The initial APIs of this module are supported since API version 10. Newly added APIs will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version.
> - The APIs of this module can be used only in the stage model.
> - The APIs provided by this module are system APIs.
