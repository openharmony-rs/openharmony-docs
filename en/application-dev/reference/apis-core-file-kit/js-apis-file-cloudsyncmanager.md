The **cloudSyncManager** module provides APIs for managing device-cloud synergy for applications. You can use the APIs to enable or disable device-cloud synergy, change the device-cloud sync switch for an application, notify cloud data changes, and clear or retain cloud files when a cloud account exits.

> **NOTE**
>
> The initial APIs of this module are supported since API version 10. Newly added APIs will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version.
