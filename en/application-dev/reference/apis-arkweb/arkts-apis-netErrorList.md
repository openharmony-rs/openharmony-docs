|ERR_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH_CERT_BAD_FORMAT | -164 | The client certificate cannot be imported into the SSL library from the platform store.|
|ERR_ICANN_NAME_COLLISION | -166 | The host name is resolved to an IP address list containing the IPv4 address 127.0.53.53. This is a special IP address recommended by ICANN. It is used to indicate that there is a name conflict and remind administrators of potential problems.|
|ERR_SSL_SERVER_CERT_BAD_FORMAT | -167 | The SSL server provides a certificate that cannot be decoded. This is not a certificate error code because no X509Certificate object is available. This error is fatal.|
|ERR_CT_STH_PARSING_FAILED | -168 | The Certificate Transparency failed to parse the signed tree head.|
|ERR_CT_STH_INCOMPLETE | -169 | The Certificate Transparency parsed signed tree head successfully, but some information is missing.|
