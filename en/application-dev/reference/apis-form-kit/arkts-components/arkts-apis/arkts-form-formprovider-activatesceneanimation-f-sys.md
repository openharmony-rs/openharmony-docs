Requests to activate a widget. This API takes effect only for [scene-based widgets](../../../form/arkts-ui-widget-configuration.md#sceneanimationparams-field). This API uses a promise to return the result. An interactive widget can be in the active or inactive state. In the inactive state, the widget is the same as a common widget. In the active state, the widget can start the **LiveFormExtensionAbility** process developed by the widget host to implement animations.
