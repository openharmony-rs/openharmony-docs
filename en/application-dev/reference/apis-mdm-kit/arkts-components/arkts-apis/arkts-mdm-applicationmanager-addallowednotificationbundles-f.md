# addAllowedNotificationBundles

## Modules to Import

```TypeScript
import { applicationManager } from '@kit.MDMKit';
```

## addAllowedNotificationBundles

```TypeScript
function addAllowedNotificationBundles(admin: Want, bundleNames: Array<string>, accountId: number): void
```

Adds applications to the notification trustlist. After the notification trustlist is set, applications not in the trustlist cannot send notifications.

> **NOTE:** 
> 
> 1. If both the Kiosk mode and the notification trustlist policy are set, applications in the Kiosk mode and those in the notification trustlist can send notifications.

> 2. If the device notification capability has been disabled via [setDisallowedPolicy](arkts-mdm-restrictions-setdisallowedpolicy-f.md), calling this API to set the notification trustlist will trigger error code 9200010.

> 3. The notification trustlist does not apply to system services, which can always send notifications. System applications are controlled by the notification trustlist.

> 4. Cross-user settings are supported. The settings take effect immediately.
