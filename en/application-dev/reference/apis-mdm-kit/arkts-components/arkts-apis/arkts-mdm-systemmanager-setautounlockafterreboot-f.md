function setAutoUnlockAfterReboot(admin: Want, isAllowed: boolean): void
```

This API is applicable to enterprise unattended devices or scenarios where services need to be quickly restored through a restart, avoiding device downtime caused by manual unlocking, thereby improving device operation and maintenance efficiency and service continuity.

**Required permissions:** ohos.permission.ENTERPRISE_MANAGE_SYSTEM

**Model restriction:** This API can be used only in the stage model.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| admin | [Want](../../apis-ability-kit/arkts-apis/arkts-ability-app-ability-want-want-c.md) | Yes | EnterpriseAdminExtensionAbility. **Want** must contain the ability name of the EnterpriseAdminExtensionAbility and the bundle name of the application. |
| isAllowed | boolean | Yes | The value **true** indicates that the device is automatically unlocked after reboot, and the value **false** indicates the opposite. |
