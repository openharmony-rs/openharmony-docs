# addKeyEventPolicies

## Modules to Import

```TypeScript
import { systemManager } from '@kit.MDMKit';
```

## addKeyEventPolicies

```TypeScript
function addKeyEventPolicies(admin: Want, keyPolicies: Array<KeyEventPolicy>): void
```

Adds a key event handling policy. When the system triggers a key event, if the event matches the delivered key event policy, the MDM app will be notified via the [EnterpriseAdminExtensionAbility.onKeyEvent](arkts-mdm-enterprise-enterpriseadminextensionability-enterpriseadminextensionability-c.md#onkeyevent) callback, with the key event information of the matched policy carried in the callback.

**Since:** 23

**Required permissions:** ohos.permission.ENTERPRISE_MANAGE_SYSTEM

**Model restriction:** This API can be used only in the stage model.

**System capability:** SystemCapability.Customization.EnterpriseDeviceManager

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| admin | [Want](../../apis-ability-kit/arkts-apis/arkts-ability-app-ability-want-want-c.md) | Yes | EnterpriseAdminExtensionAbility. **Want** must contain the ability name of the EnterpriseAdminExtensionAbility and the bundle name of the application. |
| keyPolicies | Array&lt;[KeyEventPolicy](arkts-mdm-systemmanager-keyeventpolicy-i.md)&gt; | Yes | Key policy. Physical keys (power key, volume up, and volume down) and navigation keys (back, home, and recently opened) are supported. Physical keys can be combined into a combination key, but navigation keys cannot. For details about the combination key event response, see the key event callback [onKeyEvent](arkts-mdm-enterprise-enterpriseadminextensionability-enterpriseadminextensionability-c.md#onkeyevent). |

**Error codes:**

| Error Code ID | Error Message |

**Examples**

```TypeScript
import { Want } from '@kit.AbilityKit';
import { systemManager } from '@kit.MDMKit';

let wantTemp: Want = {
  // Replace with actual values.
  bundleName: 'com.example.myapplication',
  abilityName: 'EnterpriseAdminAbility'
};

let keypolicy: Array<systemManager.KeyEventPolicy> = [
  {
    "keyCode": systemManager.KeyCode.POWER,
    "keyPolicy": systemManager.KeyPolicy.CUSTOM
  },
  {
    "keyCode": systemManager.KeyCode.VOLUME_UP,
    "keyPolicy": systemManager.KeyPolicy.CUSTOM
  }
];

try {
  systemManager.addKeyEventPolicies(wantTemp, keypolicy);
  console.info('Succeeded in adding key event policies.');
} catch (err) {
  console.error(`Failed to add key event policies. Code is ${err.code}, message is ${err.message}`);
}
