# getDefaultData

## Modules to Import

```TypeScript
import { telephonyManager } from '@kit.MDMKit';
```

## getDefaultData

```TypeScript
function getDefaultData(admin: Want): number
```

Obtains the slot ID of the SIM card currently used as the default data SIM card on the device. For example, an enterprise device administrator can query the current default data SIM during device management for data usage control or data card configuration switching. If no SIM card is inserted or the device is in airplane mode, the API returns the slot ID of the last used data SIM card. If the device has never had a default data SIM set, the API returns **0**, indicating slot 1.

**Since:** 26.0.0

**Required permissions:** ohos.permission.ENTERPRISE_MANAGE_TELEPHONY

**Model restriction:** This API can be used only in the stage model.

**System capability:** SystemCapability.Customization.EnterpriseDeviceManager

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| admin | [Want](../../apis-ability-kit/arkts-apis/arkts-ability-app-ability-want-want-c.md) | Yes | EnterpriseAdminExtensionAbility. **Want** must contain the ability name of the EnterpriseAdminExtensionAbility and the bundle name of the application. |

**Return value:**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| number | Slot ID. Currently, only single-slot and dual-slot devices are supported. The value can be **0** or **1**, where **0** indicates slot 1 and **1** indicates slot 2. |

**Error codes:**

| Error Code ID | Error Message |
| --- | --- |
| [9200001](../errorcode-enterpriseDeviceManager.md#9200001-deviceadmin-not-enabled) | The application is not an administrator application of the device. |
| [9200002](../errorcode-enterpriseDeviceManager.md#9200002-permission-denied) | The administrator application does not have permission to manage the device. |
| [201](../../errorcode-universal.md#201-permission-denied) | Permission verification failed. The application does not have the permission required to call the API. |

import { telephonyManager } from '@kit.MDMKit';

let wantTemp: Want = {
  // Replace the values as required.
  bundleName: 'com.example.myapplication',
  abilityName: 'EnterpriseAdminAbility'
};

try {
  // Obtain the slot ID of the SIM card currently used as the default data SIM card.
  let slotId: number = telephonyManager.getDefaultData(wantTemp);
  console.info(`success to get default data SIM ID, current is ${slotId}`);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(`Failed to get default data. Code: ${err.code}, message: ${err.message}`);
