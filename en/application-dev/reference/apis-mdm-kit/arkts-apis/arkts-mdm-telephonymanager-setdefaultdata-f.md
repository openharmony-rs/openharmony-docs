# setDefaultData

## Modules to Import

```TypeScript
import { telephonyManager } from '@kit.MDMKit';
```

## setDefaultData

```TypeScript
function setDefaultData(admin: Want, slotId: number): void
```

Sets the SIM card in the specified slot as the default data SIM card. The device will use the data connection from the SIM card in that slot for internet access. For example, in dual-SIM device management scenarios, an enterprise can specify a default data SIM card for employee devices to centrally manage data usage. To successfully call this API, the SIM card must be inserted and airplane mode must be turned off.

**Since:** 26.0.0

**Required permissions:** ohos.permission.ENTERPRISE_MANAGE_TELEPHONY

**Model restriction:** This API can be used only in the stage model.

**System capability:** SystemCapability.Customization.EnterpriseDeviceManager

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| admin | [Want](../../apis-ability-kit/arkts-apis/arkts-ability-app-ability-want-want-c.md) | Yes | EnterpriseAdminExtensionAbility. **Want** must contain the ability name of the EnterpriseAdminExtensionAbility and the bundle name of the application. |
| slotId | number | Yes | Slot ID. Currently, only single-slot and dual-slot devices are supported. The value can be **0** or **1**, where **0** indicates slot 1 and **1** indicates slot 2. |

**Error codes:**

| Error Code ID | Error Message |
| --- | --- |
| [9200001](../errorcode-enterpriseDeviceManager.md#9200001-deviceadmin-not-enabled) | The application is not an administrator application of the device. |
| [9200002](../errorcode-enterpriseDeviceManager.md#9200002-permission-denied) | The administrator application does not have permission to manage the device. |

| [9201020](../errorcode-enterpriseDeviceManager.md#9201020-failed-to-set-the-default-mobile-data-sim) | Failed to set the default data SIM card. The airplane mode is enabled or no SIM card is inserted. |
| [201](../../errorcode-universal.md#201-permission-denied) | Permission verification failed. The application does not have the permission required to call the API. |

**Examples**

```TypeScript
import { Want } from '@kit.AbilityKit';
import { telephonyManager } from '@kit.MDMKit';

let wantTemp: Want = {
  // Replace the values as required.
  bundleName: 'com.example.myapplication',
  abilityName: 'EnterpriseAdminAbility'
};
// Set the slot ID of the SIM card to be used as the default data SIM card.
let slotId: number = 0;
try {
  // Sets the specified slot as the default data SIM.
  telephonyManager.setDefaultData(wantTemp, slotId);
  console.info(`success to set default data SIM ID`);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(`Failed to set default data. Code: ${err.code}, message: ${err.message}`);
}
```
