# LayoutManager

```TypeScript
declare interface LayoutManager
```

Implements a layout manager object.

> **NOTE:** 
> 
> After the text content is changed, you must wait for the layout to be completed before you can obtain the most up-
> to-date layout information.

## Objects to Import

Take the Text component as an example. For a complete example, see [Example 10: Obtaining Text Information](../../../reference/apis-arkui/arkui-ts/ts-basic-components-text.md) of the Text component.

```ts
controller: TextController = new TextController();
let layoutManager: LayoutManager = this.controller.getLayoutManager();
```

## getCharacterRangeForGlyphRange

```TypeScript
getCharacterRangeForGlyphRange(glyphRange: TextRange): Array<TextRange> | undefined
```

Obtains the character range and the actual glyph range based on the specified text glyph range. The character offset of this API is UTF-8 encoding.

> **NOTE:** 
> 
> After the text content changes, wait until the layout is complete before obtaining the latest character range
> information.
> Take the text "世界Hello" as an example. The correspondence between the glyph index and the character index under
> UTF-8 encoding is as follows:

| Text | 世 | 界 | H | e | l | l | o |  
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  
| Glyph Index Range | [0, 1] | [1, 2] | [2, 3] | [3, 4] | [4, 5] | [5, 6] | [6, 7] |
| Character Index Range (UTF-8) | [0, 3] | [3, 6] | [6, 7] | [7, 8] | [8, 9] | [9, 10] | [10, 11] |

Its glyph index range is [0, 7]. Since a Chinese character occupies 3 bytes, its corresponding character index range is [0, 11]. If the specified glyph index range is [0, 11], but there are only 7 glyphs in total, the actual glyph index range is [0, 7].

**Since:** 24

**Model restriction:** This API can be used only in the stage model.

**Atomic service API:** This API can be used in atomic services since API version 24.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |

**Return value:**

## getCharacterRangeForGlyphRange

```TypeScript
getCharacterRangeForGlyphRange(glyphRange: TextRange, encoding?: TextEncoding): Array<TextRange> | undefined
```

Obtains the character range and the actual glyph range based on the specified encoding type and text glyph range.

Compared with [getCharacterRangeForGlyphRange](#getcharacterrangeforglyphrange), this API supports specifying the encoding type (UTF-8 or UTF-16) used for the character range through the **encoding** parameter.

> **NOTE:** 
> 
> After the text content changes, wait until the layout is complete before obtaining the latest character range
> information.
> Take the text "世界Hello" as an example. The correspondence between the glyph index and the character index under
> different encoding types is as follows:

| Text | 世 | 界 | H | e | l | l | o |  
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  
| Glyph Index Range | [0, 1] | [1, 2] | [2, 3] | [3, 4] | [4, 5] | [5, 6] | [6, 7] |
| Character Index Range (UTF-8) | [0, 3] | [3, 6] | [6, 7] | [7, 8] | [8, 9] | [9, 10] | [10, 11] |
| Character Index Range (UTF-16) | [0, 1] | [1, 2] | [2, 3] | [3, 4] | [4, 5] | [5, 6] | [6, 7] |

Under UTF-8 encoding, its glyph index range is [0, 7]. Since a Chinese character occupies 3 bytes, the corresponding character index range is [0, 11]. If the specified glyph index range exceeds the actual number of glyphs (for example, [0, 11]), since there are only 7 glyphs in total, the returned actual glyph index range is [0, 7].

Under UTF-16 encoding, the character index is measured in UTF-16 code units. A BMP character (such as "世") occupies 1 code unit (2 bytes), and a supplementary plane character (such as an emoji) occupies 2 code units (a 4-byte surrogate pair). Its glyph index range is [0, 7], and the corresponding character index range is [0, 7]. If the specified glyph index range exceeds the actual number of glyphs (for example, [0, 10]), since there are only 7 glyphs in total, the returned actual glyph index range is [0, 7].

## getGlyphPositionAtCoordinate

```TypeScript
getGlyphPositionAtCoordinate(x: number, y: number): PositionWithAffinity
```

Obtains the position information of the character close to the given coordinate.

> **NOTE:** 
> 
> - This API actually obtains the UTF-16 character offset, rather than the glyph offset.
> 
> - After the text content changes, wait until the layout is complete before obtaining the latest position information.

## getGlyphRangeForCharacterRange

```TypeScript
getGlyphRangeForCharacterRange(charRange: TextRange): Array<TextRange> | undefined
```

Obtains the glyph range and the actual character range based on the specified text character range. The character offset of this API is in UTF-8 encoding.

> **NOTE:** 
> 
> After the text content changes, wait until the layout is complete before obtaining the latest glyph range

> Take the text "世界Hello" as an example. The correspondence between the glyph index and the character index under

| Glyph Index Range | [0, 1] | [1, 2] | [2, 3] | [3, 4] | [4, 5] | [5, 6] | [6, 7] |
| Character Index Range (UTF-8) | [0, 3] | [3, 6] | [6, 7] | [7, 8] | [8, 9] | [9, 10] | [10, 11] |

The glyph index range of the character "世" is [0, 1]. Since a Chinese character occupies 3 bytes, its corresponding character index range is [0, 3]. If the specified character index range is [0, 1], it is impossible to parse one- third of a Chinese character, so the actual character index range is [0, 3].
