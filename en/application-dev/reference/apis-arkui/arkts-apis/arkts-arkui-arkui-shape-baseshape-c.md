**System capability:** SystemCapability.ArkUI.ArkUI.Full

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| height | [Length](arkts-arkui-length-t.md) | Yes | Height of the shape.<br>Unit: vp <br>If the value is invalid, 0 vp is used. |

**Return value:**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| T | Current object, used for chained calls. |

## size

```TypeScript
size(size: SizeOptions): T
```

Sets the size of a shape, including both the width and height.

> **NOTE:** 
> 
> - **size()** is equivalent to calling **width()** and **height()** simultaneously to set the width and height.
> 
> - A method called later overrides the corresponding property set by a method called earlier. For example, if
> **size({width:100, height:200})** is called first and then **width(50)** is called, the final width is 50 and the
> height remains 200.

**Since:** 12

**Model restriction:** This API can be used only in the stage model.

**Atomic service API:** This API can be used in atomic services since API version 12.

**Widget capability:** This API can be used in ArkTS widgets since API version 12.

When the type is string, the value is specified by [Length](arkts-arkui-length-t.md). <br>Unit: vp <br>If the value is invalid, 0 vp is used. |
