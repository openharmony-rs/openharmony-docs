## Center

```TypeScript
Center
```

The child components are aligned in the center of the main axis. The space between the first component and the main -start is the same as that between the last component and the main-end.

**Since:** 7

**System capability:** SystemCapability.ArkUI.ArkUI.Full

## End

```TypeScript
End
```

The child components are aligned with the end edge of the main axis. The last component is aligned with the main- end, and other components are aligned with the next one.

**System capability:** SystemCapability.ArkUI.ArkUI.Full

## SpaceBetween

```TypeScript
SpaceBetween
```

The child components are evenly distributed along the main axis. The space between any two adjacent components is the same. The first component is aligned with the main-start, the last component is aligned with the main-end, and the remaining components are distributed so that the space between any two adjacent components is the same.

**Since:** 7

**Atomic service API:** This API can be used in atomic services since API version 11.

## SpaceAround

```TypeScript
SpaceAround
```

The child components are evenly distributed along the main axis. The space between any two adjacent components is the same. The space between the first component and main-start, and that between the last component and main-end are both half the size of the space between two adjacent components.

**Since:** 7

**Atomic service API:** This API can be used in atomic services since API version 11.

**Widget capability:** This API can be used in ArkTS widgets since API version 9.

<!--Device-FlexAlign-SpaceAround--><!--Device-FlexAlign-SpaceAround-End-->
