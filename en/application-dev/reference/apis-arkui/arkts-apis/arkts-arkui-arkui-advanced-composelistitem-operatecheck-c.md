## accessibilityDescription

```TypeScript
accessibilityDescription?: ResourceStr
```

Accessible description of the switch, check box, or radio button on the right. You can provide comprehensive text explanations to help users understand the operation they are about to perform and its potential consequences, especially when these cannot be inferred from the component's attributes and accessibility text alone. If a component contains both text information and the accessible description, the text is announced first and then the accessible description, when the component is selected.

By default, the announcement rules for the basic components **Switch**, **CheckBox**, and **Radio** are applied.

## accessibilityText

```TypeScript
accessibilityText?: ResourceStr
```

Accessibility text, that is, accessible label name, of the switch, check box, or radio button on the right. If a component does not contain text information, it will not be announced by the screen reader when selected. In this case, the screen reader user cannot know which component is selected. To solve this problem, you can set accessibility text for components without text information. When such a component is selected, the screen reader announces the specified accessibility text, informing the user which component is selected.

Default value: **""**
