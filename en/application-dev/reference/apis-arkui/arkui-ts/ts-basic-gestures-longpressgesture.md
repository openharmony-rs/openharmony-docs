# LongPressGesture

**LongPressGesture** is used to trigger a long press gesture, which requires one or more fingers with a minimum 500 ms hold-down time.

>  **NOTE**
>
>  This gesture is supported since API version 7. Updates will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version.
>
>  On some devices, the system's two-finger long press gesture may take precedence, causing the application's two-finger long press gesture to be ineffective.


## APIs

LongPressGesture(value?: { fingers?: number, repeat?: boolean, duration?: number })

Triggers a long press gesture. In components that support drag actions by default, such as **Text**, **TextInput**, **TextArea**, **HyperLink**, **Image**, and **RichEditor**, the long press gesture may conflict with the drag action. If this occurs, the event priority is determined as follows:

If the long press duration is less than 500 milliseconds, the system prioritizes the long press event over the drag event.

If the long press duration reaches or exceeds 500 milliseconds, the system prioritizes the drag event over the long press event.

**Atomic service API**: This API can be used in atomic services since API version 11.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.ArkUI.ArkUI.Full

**Parameters**

| Name| Type| Mandatory| Description|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| fingers | number | No| Minimum number of fingers to trigger a long press gesture. The value ranges from 1 to 10.<br>Default value: **1**<br> **NOTE**<br>If a finger moves more than 15 px after being pressed, the gesture recognition fails.|
| repeat | boolean | No| Whether to continuously trigger the event callback. The value **true** means to continuously trigger the event callback, and **false** means the opposite.<br>Default value: **false**|
| duration | number | No| Minimum hold-down time, in ms.<br>Default value: **500**<br>**NOTE**<br>Value range: [0, +âˆž). If the value is less than or equal to 0, the default value **500** is used.|
| isFingerCountLimited<sup>15+</sup> | boolean | No| Whether to enforce the exact number of fingers touching the screen. With the value **true**, the gesture recognition fails if the number of fingers touching the screen does not match the configured value of **fingers**.<br>For gestures that have already been successfully recognized, changes in the number of fingers touching the screen will not trigger the **repeat** event. However, if the number of fingers touching the screen returns to the configured minimum number, the **onAction** [event](ts-basic-gestures-longpressgesture.md#events) can be triggered. The **onActionEnd** [event](ts-basic-gestures-longpressgesture.md#events) event can also be triggered regardless of the finger count.<br>**true**: Enforce the exact number of fingers touching the screen.<br>**false**: Do not enforce the exact number of fingers touching the screen.<br>Default value: **false**|


## Events

**System capability**: SystemCapability.ArkUI.ArkUI.Full

>  **NOTE**
>
>  In **fingerList** of [GestureEvent](ts-gesture-settings.md#gestureevent), the index of a finger corresponds to its position, that is, the ID of a finger in **fingerList[index]** refers to its index. If a finger is pressed first and does not participate in triggering of the current gesture, its position in **fingerList** is left empty. You are advised to use **fingerInfos** when possible.

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| onAction(event:(event: [GestureEvent](ts-gesture-settings.md#gestureevent)) =&gt; void) | Invoked when a long press gesture is recognized.<br>**Atomic service API**: This API can be used in atomic services since API version 11.|
| onActionEnd(event:(event: [GestureEvent](ts-gesture-settings.md#gestureevent)) =&gt; void) | Invoked when the last finger is lifted after the long press gesture is recognized.<br>**Atomic service API**: This API can be used in atomic services since API version 11.|
| onActionCancel(event: () =&gt; void) | Invoked when a tap cancellation event is received after the long press gesture is recognized. No gesture event information is returned.<br>**Atomic service API**: This API can be used in atomic services since API version 11.|
| onActionCancel(event: Callback<[GestureEvent](ts-gesture-settings.md#gestureevent)>)<sup>18+</sup> | Invoked when a tap cancellation event is received after the long press gesture is recognized. Gesture event information is returned.<br>**Atomic service API**: This API can be used in atomic services since API version 18.|

## Example

This example demonstrates the recognition of a long press gesture using **LongPressGesture**.

```ts
// xxx.ets
@Entry
@Component
struct LongPressGestureExample {
  @State count: number = 0;

  build() {
    Column() {
      Text('LongPress onAction:' + this.count).fontSize(28)
        // Touch and hold the text with one finger to trigger the gesture event.
        .gesture(
        LongPressGesture({ repeat: true })
          // When repeat is set to true, the event callback is triggered continuously when the gesture is detected. The triggering interval is specified by duration (500 ms by default).
          .onAction((event: GestureEvent) => {
            if (event && event.repeat) {
              this.count++
            }
          })
            // Triggered when the long press gesture ends.
          .onActionEnd((event: GestureEvent) => {
            this.count = 0
          })
        )
    }
    .height(200)
    .width(300)
    .padding(20)
    .border({ width: 3 })
    .margin(30)
  }
}
```
