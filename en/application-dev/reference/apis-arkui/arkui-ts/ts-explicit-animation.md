With **animateTo**, you can build explicit animations for state changes caused by closure code. In an animation that involves width and height changes, as in a property animation, a component's content (such as text and [canvas](ts-components-canvas-canvas.md) content) is changed straight to the final state. To enable the content to change with the width and height during the animation process, use the [renderFit](ts-universal-attributes-renderfit.md#renderfit) attribute.

>  The initial APIs of this module are supported since API version 7. Updates will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version.
>
>  The functionality of this module depends on UI context. This means that the APIs of this module cannot be used where [the UI context is unclear](../../../ui/arkts-global-interface.md). For details, see [UIContext](../arkts-apis-uicontext-uicontext.md).

## animateTo<sup>(deprecated)</sup>

animateTo(value: AnimateParam, event: () => void): void

Defines an explicit animation. This API is explicitly called to change the state to generate an animation.

**Widget capability**: This API can be used in ArkTS widgets since API version 9.

**Atomic service API**: This API can be used in atomic services since API version 11.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.ArkUI.ArkUI.Full

> **NOTE**
> - This API has been deprecated since API version 18. You are advised to use [animateTo](../arkts-apis-uicontext-uicontext.md#animateto) in [UIContext](../arkts-apis-uicontext-uicontext.md).
> - From API version 10, you can use [animateTo](../arkts-apis-uicontext-uicontext.md#animateto) in [UIContext](../arkts-apis-uicontext-uicontext.md) to specify the UI execution context.
> - Avoid using **animateTo** in **aboutToAppear** or **aboutToDisappear**.
> - When **animateTo** is called in [aboutToAppear](./ts-custom-component-lifecycle.md#abouttoappear), the component's build method is not executed yet, and internal components are not created. This means the animation has no initial values to work with and will not function as expected.
> - During [aboutToDisappear](./ts-custom-component-lifecycle.md#abouttodisappear), the component is being destroyed, so animations should not be used.
> - When a component appears or disappears, you can add animation effects through [Component Transition](./ts-transition-animation-component.md).
> - For details about the attributes that are not supported by component transition, see [Example 2](#example-2-enabling-a-component-to-disappear-after-the-animation) to use animateTo to implement the effect that the component disappears after the animation ends.
> - In certain scenarios, using animateTo with [state management V2](../../../ui/state-management/arkts-state-management-overview.md#state-management-v2) may produce unexpected results. For details, see [Using animationTo Failed in State Management V2](../../../ui/state-management/arkts-new-local.md#using-animationto-failed-in-state-management-v2).

> **Notes about PlayMode**:
>
> - **PlayMode.Normal** and **PlayMode.Alternate** are recommended. Under these settings, the first round of the animation is played forwards. If **PlayMode.Reverse** or **PlayMode.AlternateReverse** is used, the first round of the animation is played backwards. In this case, the animation jumps to the end state and then starts from there.
> - When using **PlayMode.Alternate** or **PlayMode.AlternateReverse**, make sure the final state of the animation is the same as the value of the state variable. In other words, make sure the last round of the animation is played forwards. When **PlayMode.Alternate** is used, **iterations** must be set to an odd number. When **PlayMode.AlternateReverse** is used, **iterations** must be set to an even number.
> - **PlayMode.Reverse** is not recommended. Under this setting, the animation jumps to the end state at the beginning, and its final state will be different from the value of the state variable.

## Example

### Example 1: Creating an Appearance Animation for a Component

> **NOTE**
> 
> Directly using **animateTo** can lead to the issue of [ambiguous UI context](../../../ui/arkts-global-interface.md). To avoid this, obtain the [UIContext](../arkts-apis-uicontext-uicontext.md) object using the **getUIContext()** API and then call the [animateTo](../arkts-apis-uicontext-uicontext.md#animateto) API through this object.

This example creates an animation effect when a component appears in the onAppear method.

```ts
// xxx.ets
@Entry
@Component
struct AnimateToExample {
  @State widthSize: number = 250;
  @State heightSize: number = 100;
  @State rotateAngle: number = 0;
  private flag: boolean = true;

  build() {
    Column() {
      Button('change size')
        .width(this.widthSize)
        .height(this.heightSize)
        .margin(30)
        .onClick(() => {
          if (this.flag) {
            // You are advised to use this.getUIContext()?.animateTo().
            this.getUIContext()?.animateTo({
              duration: 2000,
              curve: Curve.EaseOut,
              iterations: 3,
              playMode: PlayMode.Normal,
              onFinish: () => {
                console.info('play end');
              }
            }, () => {
              this.widthSize = 150;
              this.heightSize = 60;
            })
          } else {
            // You are advised to use this.getUIContext()?.animateTo().
            this.getUIContext()?.animateTo({}, () => {
              this.widthSize = 250;
              this.heightSize = 100;
            })
          }
          this.flag = !this.flag;
        })
      Button('stop rotating')
        .margin(50)
        .rotate({ x: 0, y: 0, z: 1, angle: this.rotateAngle })
        .onAppear(() => {
          // Start the animation when the component appears.
          // You are advised to use this.getUIContext()?.animateTo().
          this.getUIContext()?.animateTo({
            duration: 1200,
            curve: Curve.Friction,
            delay: 500,
            iterations: -1, // The value -1 indicates that the animation is played for an unlimited number of times.
            playMode: PlayMode.Alternate,
            expectedFrameRateRange: {
              min: 10,
              max: 120,
              expected: 60,
            }
          }, () => {
            this.rotateAngle = 90;
          })
        })
        .onClick(() => {
          // You are advised to use this.getUIContext()?.animateTo().
          this.getUIContext()?.animateTo({ duration: 0 }, () => {
            // Modify the property in the animation closure where duration is set to 0. This stops the previous animation and applies the new value.
            this.rotateAngle = 0;
          })
        })
    }.width('100%').margin({ top: 5 })
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Enabling a Component to Disappear After the Animation

This example demonstrates how to make a component disappear after the animation ends.

```ts
// xxx.ets
@Entry
@Component
struct AttrAnimationExample {
  @State heightSize: number = 100;
  @State isShow: boolean= true;
  @State count: number= 0;
  private isToBottom: boolean = true; // Direction: moving downward.

  build() {
    Column() {
      if (this.isShow) {
        Column()
          .width(200)
          .height(this.heightSize)
          .backgroundColor('blue')
          .onClick(() => {
            // You are advised to use this.getUIContext()?.animateTo().
            this.getUIContext()?.animateTo({
              duration: 2000,
              curve: Curve.EaseOut,
              iterations: 1,
              playMode: PlayMode.Normal,
              onFinish: () => {
                this.count--;
                if (this.count = = 0 &&!this.isToBottom) { // The component disappears only after completing the downward animation.
                  this.isShow = false;
                }
              }
            }, () => {
              this.count++;
              if (this.isToBottom) {
                this.heightSize = 60;
              } else {
                this.heightSize = 100;
              }
              this.isToBottom = !this.isToBottom;
            })
          })
      }
    }.width('100%').height('100%').margin({ top: 5 })
    .justifyContent(FlexAlign.End)
  }
}
```
