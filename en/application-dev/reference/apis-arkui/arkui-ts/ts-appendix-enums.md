| Ease                | The animation starts slowly, accelerates, and then decelerates before ending. The curve is CubicBezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0).|
| EaseIn              | The animation starts at a low speed and then picks up speed until the end. The cubic-bezier curve (0.42, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0) is used.|
| EaseOut             | The animation ends at a low speed. The cubic-bezier curve (0.0, 0.0, 0.58, 1.0) is used.|

| None      | If the animation is not executed, no style is applied to the target. After the animation is played, the initial default state is restored.    |
| Forwards  | The target component retains the state set by the last keyframe encountered during execution of the animation.                  |
| Backwards | The animation applies the values defined in the first relevant keyframe once it is applied to the target component, and retains the values during the period set by **delay**. The first relevant keyframe depends on the value of **playMode**. If **playMode** is **Normal** or **Alternate**, the first relevant keyframe is in the **from** state. If **playMode** is **Reverse** or **AlternateReverse**, the first relevant keyframe is in the **to** state.|

When there is remaining space in the height direction, the content is top-aligned with the component, so that its top part is displayed.   ![renderfit_resize_cover_top_left](figures/renderfit_resize_cover_top_left.png) |
| RESIZE_COVER_BOTTOM_RIGHT   | 15                          | While maintaining its aspect ratio in the final state, the component's content is scaled to cover the component's entire content box. When there is remaining space in the width direction, the content is right-aligned with the component, so that its right part is displayed. When there is remaining space in the height direction, the content is bottom-aligned with the component, so that its bottom part is displayed.   ![renderfit_resize_cover_bottom_right](figures/renderfit_resize_cover_bottom_right.png) |


> **NOTE**

> - In the illustrative diagrams, the blue area indicates the content, and the orange area indicates the component content box.
> - Different render fit modes create different effects during the width and height animation process. Choose the one that best fits your need.
