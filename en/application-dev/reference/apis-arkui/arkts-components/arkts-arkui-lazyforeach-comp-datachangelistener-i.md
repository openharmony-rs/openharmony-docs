# DataChangeListener

```TypeScript
declare interface DataChangeListener
```

Defines the data change listener, used to notify the **LazyForEach** component to perform corresponding rendering updates when the data source changes. It supports listening for multiple data change types, including data addition, deletion, change, move, swap, and reload.

> **NOTE:** 
> 
> In the methods of **DataChangeListener** other than **onDatasetChange**, when a parameter contains index and its
> value is negative, it is replaced with 0 by default. In **onDatasetChange**, when a single **DataOperation**
> parameter contains index and its value is outside the index range of the data source (in **DataAddOperation**,
> **index** can be equal to the data source length), rendering exceptions may occur.

**Since:** 7

**System capability:** SystemCapability.ArkUI.ArkUI.Full

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| from | number | Yes | Original position of data. The value range is [0, data source length - 1].<br>If the value is less than 0, it is treated as **0**. If the value is greater than the data source length minus 1, it is treated as the data source length minus 1. |

> 
> This API cannot be used together with the **onDatasetChange** API.

<a id="ondatareloaded-1"></a>

## onDataReloaded

```TypeScript
onDataReloaded(reuseImmediately: boolean): void
```

Notifies components to reload all data and configures whether old child components can be reused during the update. This API must be used together with **@Reusable/@ReusableV2**. It is invoked after the data reload is complete.

When reuse of old child components during the update is allowed and this API is used together with [@Reusable](../../../ui/state-management/arkts-reusable.md)/[@ReusableV2](../../../ui/state-management/arkts-new-reusableV2.md), components in the reuse pool are used first. If no component in the reuse pool can be reused but there is a reusable component among the old child components of **LazyForEach**, that component is recycled and reused as a new child component. If no reusable component exists among the old child components of **LazyForEach** either, a new child component is created.

When reuse of old child components during the update is allowed but **@Reusable/@ReusableV2** is not used, data items whose keys do not change use the original child components, while those whose keys change have their child components rebuilt.

When reuse of old child components during the update is not allowed, data items whose keys do not change use the original child components. For data items whose keys change, if **@Reusable/@ReusableV2** is used and a component is available in the reuse pool, the old component is reused; otherwise, a new child component is created.

**Since:** 26.0.1

**Model restriction:** This API can be used only in the stage model.

**Atomic service API:** This API can be used in atomic services since API version 26.0.1.

## onDatasetChange

```TypeScript
onDatasetChange(dataOperations: DataOperation[]): void
```

Invoked when data is processed in batches to notify the component of refreshing.

> **NOTE:** 
> 
> This API cannot be used together with other data operation APIs of **DataChangeListener**. For example, in the
> same **LazyForEach**, if you have called **onDataAdd**, do not call **onDatasetChange**; if you have called
> **onDatasetChange**, do not call **onDataAdd** or other data operation APIs. Different **LazyForEach** instances
> on the page do not affect each other. When data is processed in batches within the same **onDatasetChange**
> callback, if multiple **DataOperation** instances target the same index, only the first **DataOperation** will
> take effect.

**Since:** 12

**Model restriction:** This API can be used only in the stage model.

**Atomic service API:** This API can be used in atomic services since API version 12.
