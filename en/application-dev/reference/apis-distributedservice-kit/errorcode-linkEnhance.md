**Error Message**

Connect timeout.

**Description**

This error code is reported if a client connection fails due to a timeout.

## 32390202 Number of Services Exceeding the Limit

**Error Message**

The number of servers exceeds the limit.

**Description**

This error code is reported if the number of services exceeds the limit.

## 32390203 Duplicate Service Name

**Error Message**

Duplicate server name.

**Description**

This error code is reported if a service with the same name is registered repeatedly.

**Possible Causes**

5. System errors, such as null pointer, insufficient memory, unexpected distributed service restart, IPC exception, and JS engine exception.

**Solution**

View the error log to identify the error cause. Take appropriate based on the actual cause:

1. If the device ID passed to the API is the same as that obtained from the Bluetooth system API, check whether the peer device is in the advertising state.

2. If the name passed from the client to the server is the same as that passed from the server to the client, check whether the name is correct by referring to the API reference.

3. Check whether objects are used after being closed.

4. Check whether the API is correctly used by referring to the API reference.

5. If the problem persists, restart or update the application or upgrade the device version.
