| OH_NN_OPS_DETECTION_POST_PROCESS = 92 | Performs post-processing on the output of the object detection model. Specific operations include decoding the bounding box, category probability, and score output by the model, performing Non-Max suppression (NMS) to remove the overlapping bounding box, and outputting the detection result.<br>Input:<br>- **bbox**: bounding box.<br>- **scores**: category score probability.<br>- **anchors**: anchors used to generate coordinates and size of the candidate box of a detection box. In an object detection task, candidate boxes are a series of rectangular boxes preset in an image according to specific rules. These rectangular boxes usually have different sizes and aspect ratios, and are used to preliminarily predict and screen a target in the image.<br>Parameters:<br>- **inputSize**: size of the input tensor.<br>- **scale**: scaling factor used to convert the output image from the normalized form to the coordinates of the original image.<br>- **nmsIoUThreshold**: Non-Max suppression threshold, which is used to remove duplicate detection boxes.<br>- **nmsScoreThreshold**: confidence threshold, which is used to filter low-confidence detection boxes.<br>- **maxDetections**: maximum number of detection boxes that can be output for each image.<br>- **detectionsPerClass**: maximum number of detections for each category.<br>- **maxClassesPerDetection**: maximum number of detection categories in each detection box.<br>- **numClasses**: total number of detection categories.<br>- **useRegularNms**: Boolean value indicating whether to use the IoU threshold-based Non-Max suppression algorithm. When the value is **true**, the IoU threshold-based Non-Max suppression algorithm is used to filter overlapped target boxes and retain the target box with the highest score. If this parameter is set to **false**, the IoU threshold-based Non-Max suppression algorithm is not applicable.

### OH_NN_TensorType

```
enum OH_NN_TensorType
```

**Description**

Defines tensor types.<br>Tensors are usually used to set the input, output, and operator parameters of a model. When a tensor is used as the input or output of a model (or operator), set the tensor type to [OH_NN_TENSOR](capi-neural-network-runtime-type-h.md#oh_nn_tensortype). When the tensor is used as an operator parameter, select an enumerated value other than [OH_NN_TENSOR](capi-neural-network-runtime-type-h.md#oh_nn_tensortype) as the tensor type.<br>Assume that pad of the [OH_NN_OPS_CONV2D](capi-neural-network-runtime-type-h.md#oh_nn_operationtype) operator is being set. You need to set the type attribute of the [OH_NN_Tensor](capi-neuralnetworkruntime-oh-nn-tensor.md) instance to [OH_NN_CONV2D_PAD](capi-neural-network-runtime-type-h.md#oh_nn_tensortype). The settings of other operator parameters are similar. The enumerated values are named in the format OH_NN_{*Operator name*}_{*Attribute name*}.

## Function Description

### NN_OnRunDone()

```
typedef void (*NN_OnRunDone)(void *userData, OH_NN_ReturnCode errCode, void *outputTensor[], int32_t outputCount)
```

**Description**

Defines the handle of the callback function invoked when the asynchronous inference ends.

Use the **userData** parameter to specify the asynchronous inference to query. The value of **userData** is the same as that passed to [OH_NNExecutor_RunAsync](capi-neural-network-core-h.md#oh_nnexecutor_runasync). Use the **errCode** parameter to obtain the return result (defined by [OH_NN_ReturnCode](capi-neural-network-runtime-type-h.md#oh_nn_returncode) of the asynchronous inference.

**Since**: 11


**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -- | -- |
| void *userData | Identifier of asynchronous inference. The value is the same as the **userData** parameter passed to [OH_NNExecutor_RunAsync](capi-neural-network-core-h.md#oh_nnexecutor_runasync).|
| [ OH_NN_ReturnCode](capi-neural-network-runtime-type-h.md#oh_nn_returncode) errCode | Return result (defined by [OH_NN_ReturnCode](capi-neural-network-runtime-type-h.md#oh_nn_returncode) of the asynchronous inference.|
| outputTensor | Output tensor for asynchronous inference. The value is the same as the **outputTensor** parameter passed to [OH_NNExecutor_RunAsync](capi-neural-network-core-h.md#oh_nnexecutor_runasync).|
|  int32_t outputCount | Number of output tensors for asynchronous inference. The value is the same as the **outputCount** parameter passed to [OH_NNExecutor_RunAsync](capi-neural-network-core-h.md#oh_nnexecutor_runasync).|

### NN_OnServiceDied()

```
typedef void (*NN_OnServiceDied)(void *userData)
```

**Description**

Defines the handle of the callback function invoked when the device driver service terminates unexpectedly during asynchronous inference.

You need to rebuild the model if the callback is invoked.

Use the **userData** parameter to specify the asynchronous inference to query. The value of **userData** is the same as that passed to [OH_NNExecutor_RunAsync](capi-neural-network-core-h.md#oh_nnexecutor_runasync).

**Since**: 11


**Parameters**

| Name| Description                                                                                                                        |
| -- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| void *userData | Identifier of asynchronous inference. The value is the same as the **userData** parameter passed to [OH_NNExecutor_RunAsync](capi-neural-network-core-h.md#oh_nnexecutor_runasync).|
