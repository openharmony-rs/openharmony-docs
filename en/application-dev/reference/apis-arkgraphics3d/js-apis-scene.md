The @ohos.graphics.scene module brings together APIs for 3D development, streamlining the process for you to export and use them.

> **NOTE**
>
> The initial APIs of this module are supported since API version 12. Newly added APIs will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version.

## Scene

[Scene](js-apis-inner-scene.md): basic module of ArkGraphics 3D. It provides common data types such as **SceneResourceParameters** and **SceneNodeParameters**. It also provides basic methods such as glTF model loading, scene creation, and resource creation.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.ArkUi.Graphics3D

## SceneNode

[SceneNode](js-apis-inner-scene-nodes.md): 3D scenes adopt a tree structure. You can change the 3D scene by operating the node properties and the node tree structure. This module provides the types and operation methods of scene nodes in 3D graphics.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.ArkUi.Graphics3D

## SceneType

[SceneType](js-apis-inner-scene-types.md): provides the data types in 3D graphics, including vectors and quaternions.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.ArkUi.Graphics3D

## SceneResources

[SceneResources](js-apis-inner-scene-resources.md): provides basic resource types, such as materials, images, and shaders, which are commonly used in 3D graphics.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.ArkUi.Graphics3D

## ScenePostProcessSettings

[ScenePostProcessSettings](js-apis-inner-scene-post-process-settings.md): provides image post-processing methods (for example, tone mapping) in 3D graphics.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.ArkUi.Graphics3D
