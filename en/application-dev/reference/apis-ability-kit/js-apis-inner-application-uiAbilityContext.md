# UIAbilityContext

**UIAbilityContext**, inherited from [Context](js-apis-inner-application-context.md), provides the context environment for [UIAbility](js-apis-app-ability-uiAbility.md) that needs to store its status. **UIAbilityContext** provides UIAbility-related configuration and APIs for operating UIAbilities and ServiceExtensionAbilities. For example, you can use the APIs to start a UIAbility, terminate a UIAbility to which the UIAbilityContext belongs, and start, terminate, connect to, or disconnect from a ServiceExtensionAbility.

> **NOTE**
>
>  - The initial APIs of this module are supported since API version 9. Newly added APIs will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version.
>  - The APIs of this module can be used only in the stage model.

## UIAbilityContext.startAbilityForResult

startAbilityForResult(want: Want, callback: AsyncCallback&lt;AbilityResult&gt;): void

Starts an ability. This API uses an asynchronous callback to return the result. It can be called only by the main thread.

The following situations may be possible for a started ability:
 - Normally, you can call [terminateSelfWithResult](#uiabilitycontextterminateselfwithresult) to terminate the ability. The result is returned to the caller.
 - If an exception occurs, for example, the ability is killed, an error message, in which **resultCode** is **-1**, is returned to the caller.
 - If different applications call this API to start an ability that uses the singleton mode and then call [terminateSelfWithResult](#uiabilitycontextterminateselfwithresult) to terminate the ability, the normal result is returned to the last caller, and an error message, in which **resultCode** is **-1**, is returned to others.

**Example**

1. The following is an example of calling **terminateSelf** to terminate a UIAbility. By default, the application retains the snapshot in the recent tasks list.

    ```ts
    import { UIAbility } from '@kit.AbilityKit';
    import { BusinessError } from '@kit.BasicServicesKit';

    export default class EntryAbility extends UIAbility {
      onForeground() {
        try {
          this.context.terminateSelf((err: BusinessError) => {
            if (err.code) {
              // Process service logic errors.
              console.error(`terminateSelf failed, code is ${err.code}, message is ${err.message}`);
              return;
            }
            // Carry out normal service processing.
            console.info('terminateSelf succeed');
          });
        } catch (err) {
          // Capture the synchronization parameter error.
          let code = (err as BusinessError).code;
          let message = (err as BusinessError).message;
          console.error(`terminateSelf failed, code is ${code}, message is ${message}`);
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2. (Optional) To remove the mission from Recents (that is, not to retain the snapshot in the recent tasks list) when terminating the UIAbility, set the **removeMissionAfterTerminate** field to **true** in the [module.json5](../../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md) file.

    ```json
    { 
      "module": { 
        // ... 
        "abilities": [
          {
            // ...
            "removeMissionAfterTerminate": true

## UIAbilityContext.openAtomicService<sup>12+<sup>

openAtomicService(appId: string, options?: AtomicServiceOptions): Promise&lt;AbilityResult&gt;

Starts an [EmbeddableUIAbility](js-apis-app-ability-embeddableUIAbility.md) in jump-out mode and obtains the result. This API uses a promise to return the result. It can be called only by the main thread.

The following situations may be possible for a started EmbeddableUIAbility:
 - Normally, you can call [terminateSelfWithResult](#uiabilitycontextterminateselfwithresult) to terminate the EmbeddableUIAbility. The result is returned to the caller.
 - If an exception occurs, for example, the EmbeddableUIAbility is killed, an error message, in which **resultCode** is **-1**, is returned to the caller.
 - If different applications call this API to start an EmbeddableUIAbility and then call [terminateSelfWithResult](#uiabilitycontextterminateselfwithresult) to terminate the EmbeddableUIAbility, the normal result is returned to the last caller, and an exception message, in which **resultCode** is **-1**, is returned to others.

## UIAbilityContext.openLink<sup>12+<sup>

openLink(link: string, options?: OpenLinkOptions, callback?: AsyncCallback&lt;AbilityResult&gt;): Promise&lt;void&gt;

Starts a UIAbility through App Linking. This API uses a promise to return the result. It can be called only by the main thread.

A URL in the standard format is passed in to the **link** field to start the target UIAbility based on the implicit Want matching rules. The target UIAbility must have the following filter characteristics to process links of App Linking:
- The **actions** field contains **ohos.want.action.viewData**.
- The **entities** field contains **entity.system.browsable**.
- The **uris** field contains elements whose **scheme** is **https** and **domainVerify** is **true**.

If you want to obtain the result after the started UIAbility is terminated, set the **callback** parameter. For details about how to use this parameter, see [startAbilityForResult](#uiabilitycontextstartabilityforresult).
If an input parameter is invalid, for example, a mandatory parameter is not set or the URL set in **link** is not in the standard format, an exception is thrown. If the parameter verification is successful but an error occurs when starting the target UIAbility, the error information is returned through promise.

> **NOTE**
>
> For details about the startup rules for the components in the stage model, see [Component Startup Rules (Stage Model)](../../application-models/component-startup-rules.md).

**Atomic service API**: This API can be used in atomic services since API version 12.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.Ability.AbilityRuntime.Core

**Parameters**

| Name| Type| Mandatory| Description|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| link | string | Yes| URL to open, which must be in the standard format.|

## UIAbilityContext.revokeDelegator<sup>17+</sup>

revokeDelegator() : Promise&lt;void&gt;

When the first UIAbility launched under a module needs to redirect to another UIAbility, the target UIAbility is known as the DelegatorAbility. For details about how to set up the DelegatorAbility, see step 1 in the example provided for this API.

Once the DelegatorAbility has completed its specific operations, you can use this API to revert to the first UIAbility. This API uses a promise to return the result.

> **NOTE**
>
> After the API is successfully called, the [Window](../apis-arkui/js-apis-window.md) API within the DelegatorAbility becomes invalid.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.Ability.AbilityRuntime.Core

        // ...
        "abilityStageSrcEntryDelegator": "xxxModuleName",
        "abilitySrcEntryDelegator": "xxxAbilityName",
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```

2. Revoke the DelegatorAbility.

    ```ts
    import { UIAbility } from '@kit.AbilityKit';
    import { BusinessError } from '@kit.BasicServicesKit';

    export default class DelegatorAbility extends UIAbility {
      onForeground() {
        // After the DelegatorAbility completes the specific operation, call revokeDelegator to revert to the first UIAbility.
        this.context.revokeDelegator().then(() => {
          console.info('revokeDelegator success');
        }).catch((err: BusinessError) => {
          console.error(`revokeDelegator failed, code is ${err.code}, message is ${err.message}`);
        });
      }
    }
    ```
