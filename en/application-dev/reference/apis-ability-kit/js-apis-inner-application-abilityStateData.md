The AbilityStateData module defines a struct for ability state information. Once a lifecycle change listener is registered using [on](js-apis-app-ability-appManager.md#appmanageronapplicationstate14), you can obtain an instance of this struct from the input parameter of the **onAbilityStateChanged** callback of [ApplicationStateObserver](js-apis-inner-application-applicationStateObserver.md).

> **NOTE**
> 
> The initial APIs of this module are supported since API version 14. Newly added APIs will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version.

## Modules to Import
