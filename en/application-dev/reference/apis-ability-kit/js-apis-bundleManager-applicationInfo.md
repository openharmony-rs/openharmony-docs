# ApplicationInfo

The module defines the application information. An application can obtain its own application information through [bundleManager.getBundleInfoForSelf](js-apis-bundleManager.md#bundlemanagergetbundleinfoforself), with **GET_BUNDLE_INFO_WITH_APPLICATION** passed in to [bundleFlags](js-apis-bundleManager.md#bundleflag).

> **NOTE**
>
> The initial APIs of this module are supported since API version 9. Newly added APIs will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version.

## Modules to Import

```ts
import { bundleManager } from '@kit.AbilityKit';
