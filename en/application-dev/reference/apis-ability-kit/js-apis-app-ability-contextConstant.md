# @ohos.app.ability.contextConstant (Context-related Constants)

The ContextConstant module defines context-related enums. Currently, it defines only the enum of encryption levels.

> **NOTE**
> 
> The initial APIs of this module are supported since API version 9. Newly added APIs will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version.
>
> The APIs of this module can be used only in the stage model.

## Modules to Import

```ts
import { contextConstant } from '@kit.AbilityKit';

## ProcessMode<sup>12+</sup>

Enumerates the process modes of the UIAbility after it is started. It takes effect only on 2-in-1 devices and tablets.

As a property of [StartOptions](js-apis-app-ability-startOptions.md), **ProcessMode** takes effect only in [UIAbilityContext.startAbility](js-apis-inner-application-uiAbilityContext.md#startability-1) and is used to specify the process mode of the target UIAbility.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.Ability.AbilityRuntime.Core

| Name | Value| Description                                                                                                                  |
|-----| -------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NEW_PROCESS_ATTACH_TO_PARENT | 1 | A new process is created, the UIAbility is started on the process, and the process exits along with the parent process.<br>**Constraints**:<br>In this mode, the target UIAbility and caller must be in the same application.                    |
| NEW_PROCESS_ATTACH_TO_STATUS_BAR_ITEM | 2 | A new process is created, the UIAbility is started on the process, and the process is bound to the status bar icon.<br>**Constraints**:<br>In this mode, the target UIAbility and caller must be in the same application, and the application must have an icon in the status bar.                 |
| ATTACH_TO_STATUS_BAR_ITEM | 3 | The UIAbility is started, and the process of the UIAbility is bound to the status bar icon.<br>**Constraints**:<br>In this mode, the target UIAbility and caller must be in the same application, and the application must have an icon in the status bar.                 |

**Example**

  ```ts
  import { UIAbility, Want, StartOptions, contextConstant } from '@kit.AbilityKit';
  import { BusinessError } from '@kit.BasicServicesKit';

  export default class EntryAbility extends UIAbility {
    onForeground() {
      let want: Want = {
        deviceId: '',
        bundleName: 'com.example.myapplication',
        abilityName: 'MainAbility2'
      };
      let options: StartOptions = {
        processMode: contextConstant.ProcessMode.NEW_PROCESS_ATTACH_TO_STATUS_BAR_ITEM,
        startupVisibility: contextConstant.StartupVisibility.STARTUP_HIDE
      };

      try {
        this.context.startAbility(want, options, (err: BusinessError) => {
          if (err.code) {
            // Process service logic errors.
            console.error(`startAbility failed, code is ${err.code}, message is ${err.message}`);
            return;
          }
          // Carry out normal service processing.
          console.info('startAbility succeed');
        });
      } catch (err) {
        // Process input parameter errors.
        let code = (err as BusinessError).code;
        let message = (err as BusinessError).message;
        console.error(`startAbility failed, code is ${code}, message is ${message}`);
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## StartupVisibility<sup>12+</sup>

Enumerates the visibility statuses of the UIAbility after it is started. It takes effect only on 2-in-1 devices and tablets.

As a property of [StartOptions](js-apis-app-ability-startOptions.md), **StartupVisibility** takes effect only in [UIAbilityContext.startAbility](js-apis-inner-application-uiAbilityContext.md#startability-1) and specifies the visibility of the target UIAbility after it is started.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.Ability.AbilityRuntime.Core

| Name | Value| Description                                                                                                                  |
|-----| -------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| STARTUP_HIDE | 0 | The target UIAbility is hidden after it is started in the new process. The **onForeground** lifecycle of the UIAbility is not invoked.       |
| STARTUP_SHOW | 1 | The target UIAbility is displayed normally after it is started in the new process.    |

**Example**
