# @ohos.app.ability.wantConstant (Want Constants)

The wantConstant provides predefined enums and constants related to [Want](js-apis-app-ability-want.md) operations, such as the **flags** and **params** fields used during ability startup.

> **NOTE**
>
> The initial APIs of this module are supported since API version 9. Newly added APIs will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version.

## Modules to Import

```ts
import { wantConstant } from '@kit.AbilityKit';
```

## Params

Enumerates the common system-defined keywords for the [Want.parameters](js-apis-app-ability-want.md#want) field. You can use these predefined keywords to set or retrieve additional parameter information carried in application transitions. For example, during the launch phase of a UIAbility, if the value of **ABILITY_RECOVERY_RESTART** obtained from the **want** field in the **onCreate** callback is **true**, the current UIAbility has restarted due to a fault.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.Ability.AbilityBase

| ABILITY_BACK_TO_OTHER_MISSION_STACK   | ability.params.backToOtherMissionStack     | Whether redirection back across mission stacks is supported.<br>This parameter controls the redirection-back logic across applications, altering the application transition behavior when the user presses the back button.

If this parameter is not set, the system defaults to returning to the home screen.
