## 16000001 Ability Name Does Not Exist

**Error Message**

The specified ability does not exist.

**Description**

This error code is reported when the specified ability name does not exist.

**Possible Causes**

The ability to query does not exist.

**Solution**

1. Check whether the values of **bundleName**, **moduleName**, and **abilityName** in **want** are correct.
2. Check whether the application corresponding to **bundleName** in **want** is installed. You can run the following command to query the list of installed applications. If **bundleName** is not in the query result, the application is not installed.
    ```
    hdc shell bm dump -a
    ```
3. For a multi-HAP application, check whether the HAP to which the ability belongs is installed. You can run the following command to query the bundle information. If the installed application does not contain the corresponding HAP and ability, the HAP to which the ability belongs is not installed.
    ```
    hdc shell bm dump -n bundleName
    ```

## 16000002 Incorrect Ability Type

**Error Message**

Incorrect ability type.

**Description**

This error code is reported when the ability type for the API call is incorrect.

**Possible Causes**

The ability with the specified type does not support the API call.

**Solution**

1. Check whether the values of **bundleName**, **moduleName**, and **abilityName** in **want** are correct.
2. Call APIs based on the ability type. For example, call <!--Del-->[startServiceExtensionAbility](js-apis-inner-application-uiAbilityContext-sys.md#startserviceextensionability) to start the ServiceExtensionAbility, or call <!--DelEnd-->[connectServiceExtensionAbility()](js-apis-inner-application-uiAbilityContext.md#connectserviceextensionability) to connect to the ServiceExtensionAbility. Additionally, ensure that the value of **type** under **extensionAbilities** in the [module.json5](../../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md) file matches the service you are using.
