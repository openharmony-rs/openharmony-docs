<!--Adviser: @zhang_yixin13-->

This module uses Bluetooth communication technology to provide device discovery and device offline notification features for applications. The module can:

- Dynamically listen to and discovers Bluetooth devices pre-registered by the applications.
- Leverage the process startup mechanism to automatically start the [PartnerAgentExtensionAbility](js-apis-fusionConnectivity-partnerAgentExtensionAbility.md) process of the applications when the target devices appear.
- Use the process destruction mechanism to automatically destroy the [PartnerAgentExtensionAbility](js-apis-fusionConnectivity-partnerAgentExtensionAbility.md) process of the applications when all the devices go offline.
- Notify the applications of registered devices through the [PartnerAgentExtensionAbility](js-apis-fusionConnectivity-partnerAgentExtensionAbility.md) API.

> **NOTE**
> 
> - The initial APIs of this module are supported since API version 23. Newly added APIs will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version.

## Modules to Import

```js
import { partnerAgent } from '@kit.ConnectivityKit';
```

## partnerAgent.isPartnerAgentSupported

isPartnerAgentSupported(): boolean

Checks whether the local device supports the peripheral interconnection feature. If the return value of this API is **false**, other APIs in this document cannot be used.

**System capability**: SystemCapability.Communication.FusionConnectivity.Core

**Model constraint**: This API can be used only in the stage model.

**Return value**

| **Type**                 | **Description**                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| boolean | Whether the peripheral interconnection feature is supported. **true** if the peripheral interconnection feature is supported; **false** otherwise.|

**Example**

```js
import { partnerAgent } from '@kit.ConnectivityKit';
let isSupport = partnerAgent.isPartnerAgentSupported();
console.info(`This device support partner agent: ${isSupport}`);
```

## partnerAgent.bindDevice

bindDevice(deviceAddress: PartnerDeviceAddress, deviceCapability: DeviceCapability, businessCapability: BusinessCapability, partnerAgentExtensionAbilityName: string): Promise&lt;void&gt;

Registers a device. This API uses a promise to return the result.

- You are advised to use [isPartnerAgentSupported](#partneragentispartneragentsupported) to check whether the peripheral interconnection feature is supported on the device. The converged short-range peripheral interconnection module can be used only when the feature is supported.
- You can use [isDeviceBound](#partneragentisdevicebound) to check whether the device has been registered. If the device has been registered, you do not need to call **partnerAgent.bindDevice** again.
- [PartnerAgentExtensionAbility](js-apis-fusionConnectivity-partnerAgentExtensionAbility.md) must be implemented for the application first.
- After the application registers the device, if the peripheral interconnection subsystem detects the device, the [PartnerAgentExtensionAbility](js-apis-fusionConnectivity-partnerAgentExtensionAbility.md) process of the application will be activated. The application can perform service operations in the new process. Each time when the registered device is discovered or disconnected, the process will be activated and keeps running for 3 minutes (the time is updated with new notifications).
- Before registering the device, you need to complete [Bluetooth pairing](js-apis-bluetooth-connection.md#connectionpairdevice) with the device. If the device has been registered and is unpaired with Bluetooth by the user, the device discovery and offline notification features will be automatically disabled, but the registration information will be retained for 30 days. If the device is paired with Bluetooth again within the 30 days, the peripheral interconnection subsystem can restore the device discovery and offline notification features. Otherwise, the registration information will be cleared.
- You can call [getBoundDevices](#partneragentgetbounddevices) to obtain all registered devices.
- Before using **partnerAgent.bindDevice**, you are advised to inform the user to obtain the authorization for the application to register the device.

**Required permissions**: ohos.permission.ACCESS_BLUETOOTH

**System capability**: SystemCapability.Communication.FusionConnectivity.Core

**Model constraint**: This API can be used only in the stage model.

**Parameters**

| **Name**    | **Type**                                    | **Mandatory**  | **Description**                                 |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------- |
| deviceAddress | [PartnerDeviceAddress](#partneragentpartnerdeviceaddress) | Yes   | Address information of the device registered by the application.<br>The application must be configured with the **bluetoothAddress** option of the **PartnerDeviceAddress** type.|
| deviceCapability | [DeviceCapability](#partneragentdevicecapability) | Yes    | Capabilities supported by the registered device.<br> - If the [supportBR](#partneragentdevicecapability) option is set, the peripheral interconnection subsystem listens to the [ACL](../../connectivity/terminology.md#acl) connection status of the device. Once the ACL connection is established, the device is considered to be discovered successfully.<br> - If the [supportBleAdvertiser](#partneragentdevicecapability) option is set, the system starts [BLE](../../connectivity/terminology.md#ble) scanning of the device. Once the device is found, the device is considered to be discovered successfully.<br> Note:<br>  To reduce the system power consumption, if the BLE finds the device but the application does not establish a Bluetooth connection with the device within 3 minutes, the peripheral interconnection subsystem automatically stops the **PartnerAgentExtensionAbility** process of the application.|
| businessCapability | [BusinessCapability](#partneragentbusinesscapability) | Yes| Service features of the device registered by the application, including media and call control.|
| partnerAgentExtensionAbilityName | string | Yes| The value of this parameter must be the same as the value of **name** in [extensionAbilities](../../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md#extensionabilities) in the application module-level configuration file [module.json5](../../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md).|

## partnerAgent.unbindDevice

unbindDevice(deviceAddress: PartnerDeviceAddress): Promise&lt;void&gt;

Unregisters a device. This API uses a promise to return the result.
