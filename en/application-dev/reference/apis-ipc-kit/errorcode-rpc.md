2. Check whether the system has sufficient memory for the mapping operation.

## 1900002 Failed to Call ioctl

**Error Message**

Failed to call ioctl.

**Description**

Failed to call **ioctl** with the shared memory file descriptor.

**Possible Causes**

1. Invalid kernel parameters are set.
2. The specified type does not comply with the types specified when the shared memory is mapped.

**Solution**

1. Check whether the specified parameters are **PROT_EXEC**, **PROT_READ**, and **PROT_WRITE** of the **Ashmem** class.
2. Check whether the type specified is one of the types specified when the shared memory is mapped.

## 1900003 Failed to Write Data to the Shared Memory

**Error Message**

Failed to write data to the shared memory.

**Description**

Failed to write data to the shared memory.

**Possible Causes**

1. The size of a single write or total size of continuous writes exceeds the size of the shared memory.
2. The PROT_WRITE mode is not enabled for the shared memory.

**Solution**

1. Check whether the data to be read exceeds the total size of the shared memory mapped.
2. Check that PROT_WRITE is enabled for the shared memory.

## 1900004 Failed to Read Data from the Shared Memory

**Error Message**

Failed to read data from the shared memory.

**Description**

Failed to read data from the shared memory.

**Possible Causes**

1. The size of a single write or total size of continuous writes exceeds the size of the shared memory.
2. The PROT_READ mode is not enabled for the shared memory.

**Solution**

1. Check whether the data to be read exceeds the total size of the shared memory mapped.
2. Check that PROT_READ is enabled for the shared memory.

## 1900005 Operation Allowed Only for the Proxy Object

**Error Message**

Operation allowed only for the proxy object.

**Description**

This operation is allowed only on the proxy object.

**Possible Causes**

A method supported only by the **RemoteProxy** object is called for the **RemoteObject** object.

**Solution**

Check whether a method supported only by the **RemoteProxy** object is called for the **RemoteObject** object.

## 1900006 Operation Allowed Only for the Remote Object

**Error Message**

Operation allowed only for the remote object.

**Description**

This operation is allowed only on the remote object.

**Possible Causes**

A method supported only by the **RemoteObject** object is called for the **RemoteProxy** object.

**Solution**

Check whether a method supported only by the **RemoteObject** object is called for the **RemoteProxy** object.

## 1900007 Failed to Communicate with the Remote Object

**Error Message**

Communication failed.

**Description**

Failed to communicate with the remote object over IPC.

**Possible Causes**

1. The remote object has been destroyed.
2. The remote object is re-created, but the proxy object held by the local end has expired.

**Solution**

1. Check whether the remote object has been destroyed.
2. Check whether an observer for listening for the dead status of the remote object is registered, and whether the remote object is destructed and created again.

## 1900008 Invalid IPC Object

**Error Message**

The proxy or remote object is invalid.

**Description**

The proxy or remote object is invalid.

**Possible Causes**

1. The proxy object is invalid.
2. The remote object has been destroyed.

**Solution**

1. Check whether an exception occurs when the proxy object is obtained.
2. Check whether the remote object is destructed.

## 1900009 Failed to Write Data to MessageSequence

**Error Message**

Failed to write data to the message sequence.

**Description**

Failed to write data to **MessageSequence**.

**Possible Causes**

The default **MessageSequence** space is full.

**Solution**

Use the method provided by **MessageSequence** to check whether **MessageSequence** has sufficient space.

## 1900010 Failed to Read Data from MessageSequence

**Error Message**

Failed to read data from the message sequence.

**Description**

Failed to read data from **MessageSequence**.

**Possible Causes**

The data read sequence is different from the data write sequence.

**Solution**

Check that the data read sequence is the same as the data write sequence.

## 1900011 Memory Allocation Failed

**Error Message**
