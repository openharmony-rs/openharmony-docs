# @ohos.hidebug

HiDebug provides multiple methods for debugging and profiling applications. With these methods, you can obtain memory, CPU, GPU, and GC data, collect process trace and profiler data, and dump VM heap snapshots. Since most APIs of this module are both performance-consuming and time-consuming, and are defined based on the HiDebug module, you are advised to use these APIs only during the application debugging and profiling phases. If the APIs are required in other scenarios, evaluate the impact of the APIs on application performance.
