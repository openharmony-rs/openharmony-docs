## getOnBodyState

```TypeScript
static getOnBodyState(options: GetOnBodyStateOptions): void
```

Obtains the wearing state of a wearable device. This API is used to obtain the wearing state at a time, which is different from the continuous subscription mode of **subscribeOnBodyState**. Only the wearing state at the current time is returned.

Use this API when you need to obtain the current wearing state of a wearable device at a time (rather than continuously listening to changes).

After this API is called, the system returns the current wearing state through the **success** callback. This API does not continuously report data and returns the result only once.
