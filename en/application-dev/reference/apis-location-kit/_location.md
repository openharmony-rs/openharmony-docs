## Enum Description


### Location_PowerConsumptionScene

```
enum Location_PowerConsumptionScene
```
**Description**
Enumerates power consumption scenarios in a location request.

**Since**: 13

| Value| Description| 
| -------- | -------- |
| LOCATION_HIGH_POWER_CONSUMPTION  | High power consumption.<br>The mode mainly uses the GNSS positioning technology. The system uses the network positioning technology as an alternative to provide the location service for your application until the GNSS can provide stable location results.<br>During the continuous location process, the network positioning technology is used if the GNSS location result cannot be obtained within 30 seconds.<br>This policy can lead to significant hardware resource consumption and power consumption.| 
| LOCATION_LOW_POWER_CONSUMPTION  | Low power consumption.<br>This mode is applicable when your application only needs the approximate location in scenarios such as when the user is browsing news, shopping online, and ordering food.<br>It mainly uses the network positioning technology and therefore the power consumption is relatively low.| 
| LOCATION_NO_POWER_CONSUMPTION  | No power consumption.<br>Your application does not proactively start the location service. When responding to another application requesting the same location service, the system marks a copy of the location result to your application. |

```
**Description**
Enumerates error codes of the location service.

**Since**: 13

| Value| Description| 
| -------- | -------- |

```
enum Location_UseScene
```
**Description**
Enumerates use scenes in a location request.

**Since**: 13

| Value| Description| 
| -------- | -------- |
| LOCATION_USE_SCENE_NAVIGATION  | Navigation scenario.<br>This option is applicable when your application needs to obtain the real-time location of a mobile device outdoors, such as navigation for driving or walking.<br>This option mainly uses the GNSS positioning technology and therefore the power consumption is relatively high.| 
| LOCATION_USE_SCENE_SPORT  | Sport scenario.<br>This option is applicable when your application needs to record user trajectories, for example, the track recording function of sports applications.<br>This option mainly uses the GNSS positioning technology and therefore the power consumption is relatively high.|
