Enumerates use scenes in a location request.

**Since**: 13

| Enum Item| Description|
| -- | -- |
| LOCATION_USE_SCENE_NAVIGATION = 0x0401 | Navigation scenario.<br> This option is applicable when your application needs to obtain the real-time location of a mobile device outdoors, such as navigation for driving or walking.<br> This option mainly uses the GNSS positioning technology and therefore the power consumption is relatively high.|
| LOCATION_USE_SCENE_SPORT = 0x0402 | Sport scenario.<br> Applicable when your application needs to record user trajectories, for example, the track recording function of sports applications.<br> This option mainly uses the GNSS positioning technology and therefore the power consumption is relatively high.|
| LOCATION_USE_SCENE_TRANSPORT = 0x0403 | Travel scenario.<br> This option is applicable to user travel scenarios, such as taxi hailing and public transportation.<br> This option mainly uses the GNSS positioning technology and therefore the power consumption is relatively high.|
| LOCATION_USE_SCENE_DAILY_LIFE_SERVICE = 0x0404 | Daily life services.<br> This option is applicable when your application only needs the approximate location in scenarios such as when the user is browsing news, shopping online, and ordering food.<br> It mainly uses the network positioning technology and therefore the power consumption is relatively low.|
