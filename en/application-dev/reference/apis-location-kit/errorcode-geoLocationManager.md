## 3301000 Location Service Unavailable

**Error Message**

The location service is unavailable.

**Description**

This error code is reported if the location service is unavailable and relevant APIs cannot be called.

**Possible Cause**

1. The location service fails to be started, leading to a communication failure between the application and the location service.

2. The GNSS chip fails to be initialized, leading to a GNSS positioning failure.

3. The network positioning service is abnormal, leading to a network positioning failure.

**Procedure**

Add a retry mechanism.

## 3301100 Positioning Failed Because the Location Switch Is Turned Off

**Error Message**

The location switch is off.

**Description**

This error code is reported if positioning fails because the location switch is turned off.

**Possible Cause**

The location switch is turned off, which makes basic functions such as continuous positioning and immediate positioning unavailable.

**Procedure**

Display a prompt asking for enabling the location service.

## 3301200 Failed to Obtain the Positioning Result

### 1. The positioning fails due to network unavailability.

**Error Message**

The network locating is failed because the network cannot be accessed.

**Description**

This error code is reported if network positioning fails because network access is denied.

**Possible Cause**

The device cannot access the network.

**Procedure**

Check the device for Internet or Wi-Fi connectivity and an installed SIM card.<br>

### 2. The positioning result does not meet the precision requirement. As a result, the positioning times out.

**Error Message**

The positioning result does not meet the precision requirement (maxAccuracy) in the positioning request parameters.

**Description**

This error code is reported if positioning times out because the positioning result does not meet the requirement of **maxAccuracy**.

**Possible Cause**

The value of **maxAccuracy** in the positioning request parameters [LocationRequest](./js-apis-geoLocationManager.md#locationrequest) and [CurrentLocationRequest](./js-apis-geoLocationManager.md#currentlocationrequest) is too small.

**Procedure**

Increase the value of **maxAccuracy** for [LocationRequest](./js-apis-geoLocationManager.md#locationrequest) and [CurrentLocationRequest](./js-apis-geoLocationManager.md#currentlocationrequest) as follows:

- If [scenario](./js-apis-geoLocationManager.md#locationrequestscenario) is set to **NAVIGATION**, **TRAJECTORY_TRACKING** or **CAR_HAILING**, or [priority](./js-apis-geoLocationManager.md#locationrequestpriority) is set to **ACCURACY**, you are advised to set **maxAccuracy** to a value greater than **10**.

- If [scenario](./js-apis-geoLocationManager.md#locationrequestscenario) is set to **DAILY_LIFE_SERVICE** or **NO_POWER**, or [priority](./js-apis-geoLocationManager.md#locationrequestpriority) is set to **LOW_POWER** or **FIRST_FIX**, you are advised to set **maxAccuracy** to a value greater than **100**.<br>

### 3. Unable to obtain the cached location.

**Error Message**

The system does not have a cache location.

**Description**

This error code is reported if the application fails to obtain the previous location because the system has not cached the location information.

**Possible Cause**

If the system has not cached the location information, the application attempts to obtain the cached location information.

**Procedure**

If the system has not cached the location information, call [getCurrentLocation](./js-apis-geoLocationManager.md#geolocationmanagergetcurrentlocation) to obtain the real-time location information.<br>

### 4. Location failed due to other reasons.

**Error Message**

Failed to obtain the geographical location.

**Description**

This error code is reported if the location service fails, leading to a failure to obtain the positioning result.

**Possible Cause**

- Positioning times out because of weak GNSS signals.

- The system time is incorrectly set.

**Procedure**

- Move to an open area and initiate positioning again.

- Enable automatic setting on the **Time & Date** page.


## 3301300 Query Failed During Reverse Geocoding

**Error Message**

Reverse geocoding query failed.

**Description**

This error code is reported if the query during reverse geocoding has failed.

**Possible Cause**

- Network connection is poor, which makes the request fail to be sent from the device or the result fail to be returned from the cloud to the device.

- The x86 emulator does not support the reverse geocoding function. A reverse geocoding query fails if the x86 emulator is used for debugging.

**Procedure**

- For the network problem, try the reverse geocoding query again after the network is resumed.

- For the x86 emulator problem, try the reverse geocoding query again on a real device.

## 3301400 Query Failed During Geocoding

**Error Message**

Geocoding query failed.

**Description**

This error code is reported if the query during geocoding has failed.

**Possible Cause**

- A certain request parameter is incorrect, or no result can be found based on the parameter.<br>

- Network connection is poor, which makes the request fail to be sent from the device or the result fail to be returned from the cloud to the device.

**Procedure**

Check the request parameters or network status and try again.

## 3301500 Area Information Query Failed

**Error Message**

Failed to query the area information.

**Description**

This error code is reported if the query of the area information (including the country code) has failed.

**Possible Cause**

The correct area information is not found.

**Procedure**

Add a retry mechanism.

## 3301600 Geofence Operation Failed

**Error Message**

Failed to operate the geofence.

**Description**

This error code is reported if a geofence operation, for example, adding, deleting, pausing, or resuming a geofence, has failed.

**Possible Cause**

1. The GNSS chip does not support the geofence function.

2. The bottom-layer service logic is abnormal.

**Procedure**

1. Add the SysCap verification mechanism.

2. Add a retry mechanism.

## 3301601 Failed to Add a Geofence Because the Maximum Number Is Exceeded

**Error Message**

The number of geofences exceeds the maximum.

**Description**

This error code is reported if the attempt to add a geofence fails because the number of geofences has reached the maximum.

**Possible Cause**

The number of geofences has reached the maximum (that is, 1,000).

**Procedure**

Delete unnecessary geofences before adding new ones.

## 3301602 Failed to Delete a Geofence Due to an Incorrect ID

**Error Message**

Failed to delete a geofence due to an incorrect ID.
