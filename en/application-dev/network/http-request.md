## When to Use

An application can initiate a data request over HTTP. Common HTTP methods include **GET**, **POST**, **OPTIONS**, **HEAD**, **PUT**, **DELETE**, **TRACE**, and **CONNECT**. Currently, two HTTP request methods are provided. If the amount of data sent or received by the request is small, you can use [HttpRequest.request](../reference/apis-network-kit/js-apis-http.md#request). If you are uploading or downloading a large file and care about the data sending and receiving progress, you can use [HttpRequest.requestInstream](../reference/apis-network-kit/js-apis-http.md#requestinstream10). From API version 22, if you need to insert custom logic at key nodes in the "HTTP request-response" lifecycle, you can use the [HTTP Interceptor](#http-interceptor).

## Initiating HTTP Data Requests

> **NOTE**
>
> In the sample code provided in this topic, **this.context** is used to obtain the UIAbilityContext, where **this** indicates a UIAbility instance inherited from **UIAbility**. To use **UIAbilityContext** APIs on pages, see [Obtaining the Context of UIAbility](../application-models/uiability-usage.md#obtaining-the-context-of-uiability).

Complete sample code: [Http_case](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/tree/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_case)

1. Import the **http**, **BusinessError**, and **common** modules.

   <!-- @[HTTP_case_module_import_data_request](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->  
   
   ``` TypeScript
   import { http } from '@kit.NetworkKit';
   import { BusinessError } from '@kit.BasicServicesKit';
   import { common } from '@kit.AbilityKit';
   import { hilog } from '@kit.PerformanceAnalysisKit';
   ```

2. Create an **HttpRequest** object.

    Call **createHttp()** to create an **HttpRequest** object.

    <!-- @[HTTP_case_create_http_method](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->
    
    ``` TypeScript
    let context: common.UIAbilityContext = this.getUIContext().getHostContext() as common.UIAbilityContext;
    // Each httpRequest corresponds to an HTTP request task and cannot be reused.
    let httpRequest = http.createHttp();
    ```

3. Subscribe to the HTTP response header events.

    Call **httpRequest.on()** to subscribe to HTTP response header events. This API returns a response earlier than the request. You can subscribe to HTTP response header events based on service requirements.

   <!-- @[HTTP_case_http_request_on_method](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->
   
   ``` TypeScript
   // This API is used to listen for HTTP Response Header events, which is returned earlier than the result of the HTTP request. It is up to you whether to listen for HTTP response header events.
   // on('headerReceive', AsyncCallback) will be replaced by on('headersReceive', Callback) in API version 8.
   httpRequest.on('headersReceive', (header) => {
    hilog.info(0x0000, 'testTag', `header: ${JSON.stringify(header)}`);
   });
   ```


4. Initiate an HTTP request, and parse the server response event.

    Call **request()** to initiate a network request. You need to pass in the URL and optional parameters of the HTTP request. Parse the returned result based on service requirements.

   <!-- @[HTTP_case_http_request_request_method](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->
   
   ``` TypeScript
   httpRequest.request(
     // Customize EXAMPLE_URL in extraData on your own. It is up to you whether to add parameters to the URL.
     'EXAMPLE_URL',
     {
       method: http.RequestMethod.POST, // Optional. The default value is http.RequestMethod.GET. The GET method is used to retrieve data from the server while the POST method is used to submit data such as forms and files to the server.
       // You can add header fields based on service requirements.
       header: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json'
       },
       // This field is used to transfer the request body when a POST request is used. Its format needs to be negotiated with the server.
       extraData: 'data to send',
       expectDataType: http.HttpDataType.STRING, // Optional. This parameter specifies the type of the return data.
       usingCache: true, // Optional. The default value is true.
       priority: 1, // Optional. The default value is 1.
       connectTimeout: 60000 // Optional. The default value is 60000, in ms.
       readTimeout: 60000, // Optional. The default value is 60000, in ms.
       usingProtocol: http.HttpProtocol.HTTP1_1, // Optional. The default protocol type is automatically specified by the system.
       usingProxy: false, // Optional. By default, network proxy is not used. This field is supported since API version 10.
       caPath: '/path/to/cacert.pem', // Optional. The prebuilt CA certificate is used by default. This field is supported since API version 10.
       clientCert: { // Optional. The client certificate is not used by default. This field is supported since API version 11.
         certPath: '/path/to/client.pem', // The client certificate is not used by default. This field is supported since API version 11.
         keyPath: '/path/to/client.key', // If the certificate contains key information, an empty string is passed. This field is supported since API version 11.
         certType: http.CertType.PEM, // Certificate type, optional. A certificate in the PEM format is used by default. This field is supported since API version 11.
         keyPassword: 'passwordToKey' // Password of the key file, optional. It is supported since API version 11.
       },
       // Optional. This field is valid only when content-Type in the header is multipart/form-data. It is supported since API version 11.
       // This field is used to upload binary data to the server. You can set the field based on the data type to be uploaded.
       multiFormDataList: [
         {
           name: 'Part1', // Data name. This field is supported since API version 11.
           contentType: 'text/plain', // Data type. This field is supported since API version 11. The data to upload must be a common text file.

         filePath: `${context.filesDir}/fileName.txt`, // File path, optional. This field is supported since API version 11.
         remoteFileName: 'fileName.txt' // Optional. This field is supported since API version 11.
         }, {
           name: 'Part3', // Data name. This field is supported since API version 11.
           contentType: 'image/png', // Data type. This field is supported since API version 11. The data to be uploaded must be a PNG image.

           filePath: `${context.filesDir}/fileName.mpeg`, // File path, optional. This field is supported since API version 11.
           remoteFileName: 'fileName.mpeg' // Optional. This field is supported since API version 11.
         }, {
           name: 'Part5', // Data name. This field is supported since API version 11.
           contentType: 'video/mp4', // Data type. This field is supported since API version 11. The data to be uploaded must be an MP4 video file.

           filePath: `${context.filesDir}/fileName.mp4`, // File path, optional. This field is supported since API version 11
           remoteFileName: 'fileName.mp4' // Optional. This field is supported since API version 11.
         }
       ]
     }, (err: BusinessError, data: http.HttpResponse) => {
     if (!err) {
       // ...
       // data.result carries the HTTP response. Parse the response based on service requirements.
       hilog.info(0x0000, 'testTag', `Result: ${JSON.stringify(data.result)}`);
       hilog.info(0x0000, 'testTag', `code: ${JSON.stringify(data.responseCode)}`);
       // data.header carries the HTTP response header. Parse the content based on service requirements.
       hilog.info(0x0000, 'testTag', `header: ${JSON.stringify(data.header)}`);
       hilog.info(0x0000, 'testTag', `cookies: ${JSON.stringify(data.cookies)}`);
       // Call destroy() to destroy the httpRequest object when it is no longer needed.
       httpRequest.destroy();
     } else {
       // ...
       hilog.error(0x0000, 'testTag', `error: ${JSON.stringify(err)}`);
       // Unsubscribe from HTTP Response Header events.
       httpRequest.off('headersReceive');
       // Call the destroy() method to release resources after HttpRequest is complete.
       httpRequest.destroy();
     }
   }
   );
   ```


5. Unsubscribe from HTTP response header events.

    Call **off()** to unsubscribe from HTTP response header events.

    ```ts
    // Unsubscribe from HTTP response header events when the callback information is no longer needed. For details about how to use the API, see the sample code in step 4.
    httpRequest.off('headersReceive');
    ```
6. Call **destroy()** to destroy the **httpRequest** object when it is no longer needed.

    Call **httpRequest.destroy()** to release resources after the request is processed.

    ```ts
    // Call destroy to destroy the httpRequest when it is no longer needed. For details about how to use the API, see the sample code in step 4.
    httpRequest.destroy();
    ```
## Initiating an HTTP Streaming Request

HTTP streaming refers to the process where, when handling an HTTP response, only a small chunk of the response content is processed at a time, rather than loading the entire response into memory all at once. This is particularly useful for scenarios such as processing large files and real-time data streams, among others.

Complete sample code: [Http_case](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/tree/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_case)

1. Import the **http**, **BusinessError**, and **common** modules.

     <!-- @[HTTP_case_module_import_data_request](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->
     
     ``` TypeScript
     import { http } from '@kit.NetworkKit';
     import { BusinessError } from '@kit.BasicServicesKit';
     import { common } from '@kit.AbilityKit';
     import { hilog } from '@kit.PerformanceAnalysisKit';
     ```

2. Create an **HttpRequest** object for HTTP streaming.

    Call **createHttp()** to create an **HttpRequest** object.

    <!-- @[request_in_stream_create_http_method](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->
    
    ``` TypeScript
    // Each httpRequest corresponds to an HTTP request task and cannot be reused.
    let httpRequest = http.createHttp();
    ```

3. Subscribe to HTTP streaming response events on demand.

	The server response is returned via the **dataReceive** callback. You can subscribe to this callback to obtain the server response. You can also subscribe to other streaming response events as needed.
  
   <!-- @[request_in_stream_data_receive](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->
   
   ``` TypeScript
   // Subscribe to events indicating receiving of HTTP streaming responses.
   let res = new ArrayBuffer(0);
   // ...
   // Register an observer for events indicating receiving of HTTP streaming responses.
   httpRequest.on('dataReceive', (data: ArrayBuffer) => {
     const newRes = new ArrayBuffer(res.byteLength + data.byteLength);
     const resView = new Uint8Array(newRes);
     resView.set(new Uint8Array(res));
     resView.set(new Uint8Array(data), res.byteLength);
     res = newRes;
     hilog.info(0x0000, 'testTag', `res length: ${res.byteLength}`);
   });
   
   // Subscribe to events indicating completion of receiving HTTP streaming responses.
   httpRequest.on('dataEnd', () => {
     hilog.info(0x0000, 'testTag', `No more data in response, data receive end`);
   });
   
   // Subscribe to events indicating progress of receiving HTTP streaming responses. When downloading data from the server, you can obtain the data download progress through this callback.
   httpRequest.on('dataReceiveProgress', (data: http.DataReceiveProgressInfo) => {
     hilog.info(0x0000, 'testTag', 'dataReceiveProgress receiveSize:' + data.receiveSize + ', totalSize:' + data.totalSize);
   });
   
   // Subscribe to events indicating progress of sending HTTP streaming responses. When uploading data from the server, you can obtain the data upload progress through this callback.
   httpRequest.on('dataSendProgress', (data: http.DataSendProgressInfo) => {
     hilog.info(0x0000, 'testTag', 'dataSendProgress receiveSize:' + data.sendSize + ', totalSize:' + data.totalSize);
   });
   ```

4. Initiate an HTTP streaming request to obtain server data.

   <!-- @[request_in_stream_get_server_data](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->
   
   ``` TypeScript
   let streamInfo: http.HttpRequestOptions = {
     method: http.RequestMethod.POST, // Optional. The default value is http.RequestMethod.GET. The GET method is used to retrieve data from the server while the POST method is used to submit data such as forms and files to the server.
     // You can add header fields based on service requirements.
     header: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json'
     },
     // This field is used to transfer the request body when a POST request is used. Its format needs to be negotiated with the server.
     extraData: 'data to send', // Request body
     expectDataType: http.HttpDataType.STRING, // Optional. This parameter specifies the type of the return data.
     usingCache: true,  // Optional. The default value is true.
     priority: 1, // Optional. The default value is 1.
     connectTimeout: 60000 // Optional. The default value is 60000, in ms.
     readTimeout: 60000, // Optional. The default value is 60000, in ms. If a large amount of data needs to be transmitted, you are advised to set this parameter to a larger value to ensure normal data transmission.
     usingProtocol: http.HttpProtocol.HTTP1_1 // Optional. The default protocol type is automatically specified by the system.
   };
   
   // Customize EXAMPLE_URL in extraData on your own. It is up to you whether to add parameters to the URL.
   httpRequest.requestInStream('EXAMPLE_URL', streamInfo)
     .then((data: number) => {
       // ...
       hilog.info(0x0000, 'testTag', `requestInStream OK!`);
       hilog.info(0x0000, 'testTag', `ResponseCode : ${JSON.stringify(data)}`);
       // Unsubscribe from the events subscribed in step 3, and call the destroy method to destroy the httpRequest object.
       this.destroyRequest(httpRequest);
       // ...
     }).catch((err: Error) => {
       // ...
       hilog.error(0x0000, 'testTag', `requestInStream ERROR : err = ${JSON.stringify(err)}`);
       // Unsubscribe from the events subscribed in step 3, and call the destroy method to destroy the httpRequest object.
       this.destroyRequest(httpRequest);
     })
   ```


5. Unsubscribe from the HTTP streaming response events subscribed in step 3, and call **destroy()** to destroy the **httpRequest** object.

    Call the **off()** API of the **httpRequest** object to unsubscribe from the events subscribed in step 3. When the request is complete, call **destroy()** to destroy the **httpRequest** object. For details about how to use this API, see the sample code in step 4.

   <!-- @[request_in_stream_destroy_request_method](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->
   
   ``` TypeScript
   public destroyRequest(httpRequest: http.HttpRequest) {
     // Unsubscribe from the events indicating receiving of HTTP streaming responses.
     httpRequest.off('dataReceive');
     // Unsubscribe from the events indicating progress of sending HTTP streaming responses.
     httpRequest.off('dataSendProgress');
     // Unsubscribe from the events indicating progress of receiving HTTP streaming responses.
     httpRequest.off('dataReceiveProgress');
     // Unsubscribe from the events indicating completion of receiving HTTP streaming responses.
     httpRequest.off('dataEnd');
     // Call destroy() to destroy the httpRequest object when it is no longer needed.
     httpRequest.destroy();
   }
   ```
## Initiating a WebDAV Request Using HTTP

In API version 23 and later versions, HTTP requests support WebDAV-based file access. WebDAV is an extension of HTTP and supports operations such as creating, reading, updating, deleting, moving, and copying (MKCOL, GET, PUT, DELETE, MOVE and COPY) files on remote servers.

Complete sample code: [Http_case](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/tree/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_case)

<!-- @[HTTP_webDav](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/WebDav.ets) -->

``` TypeScript
import { http } from '@kit.NetworkKit';
import { ComponentId } from '../common/CommonConstant';
import { hilog } from '@kit.PerformanceAnalysisKit';

@Entry
@Component
struct Index {
  proppatchXml = `example_proppatchXml`; // Modify the resource XML.
  lockXml: string = `example_lockXml`; // Lock the XML.
  lockToken: string = '';

  build() {
    Column({ space: 5 }) {
      Button($r('app.string.HTTP_WEBDAV_PUT'))
        .id(ComponentId.HTTP_WEBDAV_PUT)
        .onClick(async () => {
          let httpRequest = http.createHttp();
          let file = 'example';
          httpRequest.request('EXAMPLE_URL' + 'example.txt',
            {

## Configuring Certificate Verification

Certificate-related configurations are required for using the HTTPS protocol. The applications that provide services for Internet users only need to trust the system's prebuilt CA certificates. Currently, the HTTP module trusts the CA certificates preset in the system by default. No special setting is required. If an application needs to trust only the certificates specified by developers, or skip certificate verification, you can configure certificate pinning.

### Certificate Verification Process on the TLS Client

   During the TLS handshake, the client verifies the server certificate to ensure that the connection is trusted. The server certificate usually includes the domain name certificate and intermediate CA certificate.

 **Certificate Chain Composition**
 
   The certificate chain adopts the hierarchical trust structure: **server certificate ← intermediate CA certificate ← root CA certificate**. The **←** symbol indicates the issuance and trust relationship. The certificate chain must be fully traceable back to a trusted root certificate.

**Process to Be Verified**

   After receiving the certificate chain, the client performs three-level verification:

1. Verify the integrity of the certificate chain.
   - Starting from the server certificate, verify the digital signature level by level to ensure that each level of the certificate is validly issued by the previous level, thereby forming a complete trust chain.

2. Verify the trustworthiness of the root certificate.
   - Check whether the root certificate exists in the certificate repository.
   - The repository sources are as follows:
     - Preset certificate.
     - Application trust certificate.
     - CA certificate specified by the request.
   - You can specify the application-level and request-level trust certificates using related APIs (for details, see the following **Configuration Reference**).

3. Verify the validity of the certificate content.
   - Certificate validity period check.
   - Domain name matching verification: The subject alternative name (SAN) and common name (CN) are the same as the access domain name.
   - Certificate revocation status check: Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).

 Verification Result
 
   - Verification succeeds: The TLS handshake continues and a secure connection is established.
   - Verification fails: The connection is terminated and an error message is displayed.

This process ensures that only the server that holds a valid and trusted certificate can establish a secure connection.

 **Configuration Reference**
 
1. Configuring the application trust certificate: [Network Connection Security Configuration](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/best-practices/bpta-network-ca-security#section5454123841911).
2. Configuring the request-level CA certificate:
   - Configuring the HTTPS request CA certificate through the caPath and caData fields of [httprequestoptions](../reference/apis-network-kit/js-apis-http.md#httprequestoptions).
   - Configuring the WebSocket request CA certificate through the caPath field of [websocketrequestoptions](../reference/apis-network-kit/js-apis-webSocket.md#websocketrequestoptions).
   - Specifying the TLS request CA certificate through the ca field of [tlssecureoptions](../reference/apis-network-kit/js-apis-socket.md#tlssecureoptions9).
3. Configuring certificate verification skipping:
   - HTTPS: configure through [remoteValidation](../reference/apis-network-kit/js-apis-http.md#remotevalidation18) = 'skip'.
   - WebSocket: configure through skipServerCertVerification = false of [websocketrequestoptions](../reference/apis-network-kit/js-apis-webSocket.md#websocketrequestoptions).
   - TLSSocket: configure through skipRemoteValidation = false of [tlsconnectoptions](../reference/apis-network-kit/js-apis-socket.md#tlsconnectoptions9).

 **Debugging Reference**
 
   - Check whether the specified certificate is trusted through the API. For details, see [networkSecurity.certVerification](../reference/apis-network-kit/js-apis-networkSecurity.md#networksecuritycertverification).
   - Check whether the certificate chain of the domain name server is trusted by the system using the openssl command: `hdc shell openssl s_client -connect *host name*:*port* -CApath /etc/security/certificates -brief` If `Verification: OK` is displayed, the certificate chain is trusted. You can replace `-trace -showcerts` with `-brief` to print detailed TLS handshake information.


### Certificate Pinning

You can prebuild application-level certificates or a public key hash values for certificate pinning. This way, an HTTPS connection can be established only when the prebuilt certificate is used.

Both modes are configured through `src/main/resources/base/profile/network_config.json`. In the configuration file, you can create mapping between prebuilt certificates and network servers.

If you do not know the certificate mapping a server domain name, you can use the following command to obtain the certificate. When running the command, change `www.example.com` to the server domain name and `www.example.com.pem` to the name of the obtained certificate file.

```ts
openssl s_client -servername www.example.com -connect www.example.com:443 \
    < /dev/null | sed -n "/-----BEGIN/,/-----END/p" > www.example.com.pem
```

If you are using a Windows environment, you need to:

* Replace `/dev/null` with `NUL`.
* Press **Enter** to exit. This is different from OpenSSL of Linux, which may exit until the user enters a value.
* If the **sed** command is not present, copy the content between `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` (with these two lines included) in the command output and save it.

**Prebuilding Application-level Certificate**

Prebuilding application-level certificates means to embed the original certificate files in the application. Currently, certificate files in the **.crt** and **.pem** formats are supported.

> **NOTE**
>
> Currently, certificate pinning has been enabled for the ohos.net.http and Image components, and the hash values of all certificates in the certificate chain are matched. If any certificate is updated on the server, the verification fails. Therefore, if any certificate on the server has been updated, upgrade the application to the latest version as soon as possible. Otherwise, network connection may fail.

**Prebuilding Certificate Public Key Hash Values**

You can create mapping between public key hash values and domain name certificates in the configuration file. This way, access to the domain name is allowed only if the used domain name certificate matches the prebuilt public key hash value.

The public key hash value of the domain name certificate can be calculated using the following command. Assume that the domain name certificate is obtained using the preceding OpenSSL command and saved in the `www.example.com.pem` file. The line that starts with # is treated as a comment.

```ts
# Extract the public key from the certificate.
openssl x509 -in www.example.com.pem -pubkey -noout > www.example.com.pubkey.pem
# Convert the public key from the pem format to the der format.
openssl asn1parse -noout -inform pem -in www.example.com.pubkey.pem -out www.example.com.pubkey.der
# Calculate the SHA256 of the public key and convert it to Base64.
openssl dgst -sha256 -binary www.example.com.pubkey.der | openssl base64
```

**Example JSON Configuration File**

The following is an example of prebuilt application-level certificates. For details about the configuration path, see [Network Connection Security Configuration](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/best-practices/bpta-network-ca-security#section5454123841911).

### Configuring Untrusted User-Installed CA Certificates

By default, the system trusts the prebuilt CA certificates and user-installed CA certificates. To further improve security, you can configure untrusted user-installed CA certificates in **src/main/resources/base/profile/network_config.json**. For more network connection security configurations, see [Network Connection Security Configuration](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/best-practices/bpta-network-ca-security#section5454123841911).

```json
{
  "network-security-config": {
    ... ...
  },
  "trust-global-user-ca": false, // Set whether to trust the CA certificate manually installed by the enterprise MDM system or device administrator. The default value is true.
  "trust-current-user-ca" : false // Set whether to trust the certificate installed by the current user. The default value is true.
}
```
### Configuring Plaintext HTTP Access Permissions

This configuration item is used to control whether HTTP requests can be transmitted in plaintext. The following is an example of configuring plaintext HTTP access permissions (including application, component, and domain name configurations) and the description of each field. For more network connection security configurations, see [Network Connection Security Configuration](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/best-practices/bpta-network-ca-security#section5454123841911).
> **NOTE**
>
> The configuration priority rules are as follows: **component-config** > **domain-config** > **base-config**. The configuration with a higher priority overrides the configuration with a lower priority.


```json
// src/main/resources/base/profile/network_config.json
{
  "network-security-config": {
    "base-config": {
      "cleartextTrafficPermitted": true // Optional, supported since API 20.
    },
    "domain-config": [

## HTTP Interceptor

From API version 22, the HTTP Interceptor module provides a powerful and customizable mechanism that allows developers to insert custom logic at key points in the "HTTP request-response" lifecycle. With interceptors, you can implement global features such as request header/body modification, cache policy, redirection, network monitoring, and response preprocessing without modifying the core network code.

### Intercept Point Description

| Point Name                       | Position Description                                                    | Output and Input Parameters of the interceptorHandle API for the Intercept Point                                                  |
| :-------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| INITIAL_REQUEST  | The first intercept point after the initial request is assembled. Suitable for adding global parameters, signing, and encrypting the request body.| The output parameter **true** indicates that the **request** value in the input parameter is the original value and can be modified, while the **response** value is empty and cannot be modified.<br>The output parameter **false** indicates that the **request** value in the input parameter is the original value and cannot be modified, while the **response** value is empty and can be modified.|
| CONNECT_NETWORK| Located before a network connection is established, for example, a TCP/TLS connection. Suitable for network link-related operations, such as recording the network connection start time.| The output parameter **true** indicates that the **request** value in the input parameter is the original value and can be modified, while the **response** value is empty and cannot be modified.<br>The output parameter **false** indicates that the **request** value in the input parameter is the original value and cannot be modified, while the **response** value is empty and can be modified.|
| CACHE_CHECKED      | Located after the cache check logic hits the cache and determined that the cache is available. Suitable for viewing the cache value or modifying the queried cache result.| The output parameter **true** indicates that the **request** value in the input parameter is the original value and cannot be modified, while the **response** value is the original value and cannot be modified.<br>The output parameter **false** indicates that the **request** value in the input parameter is the original value and cannot be modified, while the **response** value is the original value and can be modified.|
| REDIRECTION      | Located before a redirection response is received and a new request is ready to be sent. Allows the target URL or request information of redirection to be modified.| The output parameter **true** indicates that the **request** value in the input parameter is the original value and the URL can be modified. The **response** value is the original value and the modification is invalid.<br>The output parameter **false** indicates that the **request** value in the input parameter is the original value and cannot be modified, while the **response** value is the original value and can be modified.|
| FINAL_RESPONSE   | Located after the final response is obtained. The last intercept point, which is suitable for unified decryption, parsing, logging, and error handling of responses.| The output parameter **true** indicates that the **request** value in the input parameter is the original value and cannot be modified, while the **response** value is the original value and cannot be modified.<br>The output parameter **false** indicates that the **request** value in the input parameter is the original value and cannot be modified, while the **response** value is the original value and can be modified.|

**Sequential Execution**: The interceptor is triggered in the sequence specified by INITIAL_REQUEST > CACHE_CHECKED > NETWORK_CONNECT > (REDIRECTION) > FINAL_RESPONSE. (The bracket indicates that if the request involves redirection, it will go through the redirection interceptor.)

**Redirection Loop**: This is the most critical loop in the process. When the **REDIRECTION** interceptor is triggered, the process jumps back to the **NETWORK_CONNECT** phase and starts a new request cycle until no redirection occurs. This ensures that the new request after redirection can be correctly processed by all necessary interceptors (such as adding authentication headers and recording logs).

**Cache interception**: **CACHE_CHECKED** is a decision point. If the cache exists and is valid, the request is processed by **CACHE_CHECKED** and directly jumps to the **FINAL_RESPONSE** phase to return the cache data, avoiding unnecessary network operations.

### HTTP Interceptor Development Procedure

1.  Import the modules required by the HTTP request interceptor.

    <!-- @[HTTP_interceptor_case_import](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_interceptor_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->  
    
    ``` TypeScript
    import { http } from '@kit.NetworkKit';
    import { BusinessError } from '@kit.BasicServicesKit';
    import { hilog } from '@kit.PerformanceAnalysisKit';
    ```

2.  Call [createHttp()](../reference/apis-network-kit/js-apis-http.md#httpcreatehttp) to create an **HttpRequest** object.

     <!-- @[HTTP_interceptor_case_creat_request](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_interceptor_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->
     
     ``` TypeScript
     // Create an HTTP request.
     let httpRequest: http.HttpRequest = http.createHttp();
     ```

3.  Call the **HttpInterceptorChain()** method to create an interceptor chain object.

    <!-- @[HTTP_interceptor_case_chain](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_interceptor_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->
    
    ``` TypeScript
    // Create an interceptor chain.
    let chain: http.HttpInterceptorChain = new http.HttpInterceptorChain();
    ```

4.  Create an interceptor class to implement the **http.HttpInterceptor** API.

    <!-- @[HTTP_interceptor_case_creat_http_interceptor](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_interceptor_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->

        hilog.info(0xFF00, 'httpNormalRequest', `NETWORK_CONNECT, Update rsp: ${JSON.stringify(rspContext)}`);
        return Promise.resolve(this.result);
      }
    }
    
    class FinalHttpInterceptor implements http.HttpInterceptor {
      interceptorType: InterceptorType = InterceptorType.INITIAL_REQUEST;
      result: boolean = false;

        return Promise.resolve(this.result);
      }
    }
    ```

5.  Call the **addChain()** method to add the required interceptor instance to the interceptor chain.

    <!-- @[HTTP_interceptor_case_addChain](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_interceptor_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->
    
    ``` TypeScript
    // Create the required interceptor object and add it to the interceptor chain.
    chain.addChain([
      new InitialHttpInterceptor(InterceptorType.INITIAL_REQUEST, true),
      new NetworkHttpInterceptor(InterceptorType.NETWORK_CONNECT, true),
      new FinalHttpInterceptor(InterceptorType.FINAL_RESPONSE, true)
    ]);
    ```

6.  Call the **apply()** method to attach the configured interceptor chain to **httpRequest**.

    <!-- @[HTTP_interceptor_case_apply](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_interceptor_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->
    
    ``` TypeScript
    // Attach the configured interceptor chain to **httpRequest**.
    chain.apply(httpRequest);
    ```

7.  Create request options.

    <!-- @[HTTP_interceptor_case_options](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_interceptor_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->
    
    ``` TypeScript
    // Create request options.
    let options: http.HttpRequestOptions = {
      method: http.RequestMethod.POST,
      header: { 'content-type': 'text/html' } as Record<string, string>,
      extraData: { 'context': 'BODY' } as Record<string, string>,
    };
    ```

8.  Call the **request()** method of this object to initiate a network request. You need to pass in the URL and optional parameters of the HTTP request. Parse the server response event as required.

    <!-- @[HTTP_interceptor_case_request](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_interceptor_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->
    
    ``` TypeScript
    // Initiate a request.
    httpRequest.request(EXAMPLE_URL, options, (err: BusinessError, res: http.HttpResponse) => {
      if (err) {
        hilog.error(0xFF00, 'httpNormalRequest', `request fail, error code: ${err.code}, msg: ${err.message}`);
        // ...
      } else {
        hilog.info(0xFF00, 'httpNormalRequest', `res:${JSON.stringify(res)}`);
        // ...
      }
      // ...
    });
    ```

9.  Call the **destroy()** method to destroy the HTTP request.

    <!-- @[HTTP_interceptor_case_request_destroy](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/code/DocsSample/NetWork_Kit/NetWorkKit_Datatransmission/HTTP_interceptor_case/entry/src/main/ets/pages/Index.ets) -->
    
    ``` TypeScript
    // Destroy the request.
    httpRequest.destroy();
    ```
