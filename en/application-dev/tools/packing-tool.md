The packing tool packs compiled files for installation and release. You can use DevEco Studio or the JAR package of the packing tool to pack files. The JAR package is usually stored in the **toolchains** directory of the SDK.

The packing tool supports the generation of HAP (module package of the ability type), HSP (dynamically shared package), APP (application program package), HQF (quick fix module package), and APPQF (quick fix package) files.

You can obtain the files in the packing command from [DevEco Studio build products](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/ide-compile-build) by performing the following operations:<br>
1. In the **/hvigor/hvigor-config.json5** file in the root directory of the DevEco Studio project, change the value of **level** under **logging** to **debug**.<br>
2. On the DevEco Studio menu bar, choose **Build** > **Clear projects**.<br>
3. On the DevEco Studio menu bar, choose **Build** > **Build App(s)**.<br>
4. In the **Build** window at the bottom of DevEco Studio, search for **app_packing_tool.jar** and check the file path in the packing parameters.<br>

The packaging tool verifies the validity of the attributes in the **module.json** file. The **module.json** file is a build product, whose attribute values are automatically generated during building. The mapping between the attribute values and configuration items in the configuration file is as follows.

**Table 1** Mapping between attributes of the module.json file and items of the configuration file

## Constraints

- The packing tool must run in Java 8 or later.
- Parameters and parameter values must be in pairs. For example, in the HAP packing command **--resources-path \<path>**, **--resources-path** is the command parameter and **path** is the parameter value. The two parameters must be used together.

## HAP Packing Command

You can use the JAR package of the packing tool to generate an HAP file for a module by passing in packing options and file paths.

**Validity Verification During HAP Packing**
- Since API version 21, if more than 50 URL schemes are configured for **querySchemes** in the **module.json** file when the HAP of the entry type is packaged, the value of **minAPIVersion** must be greater than or equal to 21.

**Compressing Rules During HAP Packing**
- If **compressNativeLibs** is set to **true**, files in the directory specified by **--lib-path** are compressed based on the compression level specified by **--compress-level**.
- To ensure running performance, files that are not in the directory specified by **--lib-path** are not compressed.

Packing command example:
- Packing command example in the [stage model](../../application-dev/application-models/application-models.md#application-model-overview):


    ```
    java -jar app_packing_tool.jar --mode hap --json-path <path> [--resources-path <path>] [--ets-path <path>] [--index-path <path>] [--pack-info-path <path>] [--lib-path <path>] --out-path <path> [--force true] [--compress-level 5] [--pkg-context-path <path>] [--hnp-path <path>]
    ```

- Packing command example in the [FA model](../../application-dev/application-models/application-models.md#application-model-overview):


    ```
    java -jar app_packing_tool.jar --mode hap --json-path <path> [--maple-so-path <path>] [--profile-path <path>] [--maple-so-dir <path>] [--dex-path <path>] [--lib-path <path>] [--resources-path <path>] [--index-path <path>] --out-path <path> [--force true] [--compress-level 5]
    ```

## HSP Packing Command

HSP files enable file sharing among multiple HAPs. You can use the JAR package of the packing tool to generate an HSP file for an application by passing in packing options and file paths.

**Compressing Rules During HSP Packing**
- If **compressNativeLibs** is set to **true**, files in the directory specified by **--lib-path** are compressed based on the compression level specified by **--compress-level**.
- To ensure running performance, files that are not in the directory specified by **--lib-path** are not compressed.

Packing command example:
```
java -jar app_packing_tool.jar --mode hsp --json-path <path> [--resources-path <path>] [--ets-path <path>] [--index-path <path>] [--pack-info-path <path>] [--lib-path <path>] --out-path <path> [--force true] [--compress-level 5] [--pkg-context-path <path>]
```

## APP Packing Command

You can use the JAR package of the packing tool to generate an APP file for an application by passing in packing options and file paths. The APP file is used to release the application to the application market.

**Table 4** Validity verification rules during APP packing

| Fields in module.json of HAP/HSP That Are Verified | Verification Rules                          |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **name** field in module               | All HAP/HSP **name** fields must be different.     |
| bundleName                       | All HAP/HSP **bundleName** fields must be the same. |
| bundleType                       | All HAP/HSP **bundleType** fields must be the same. |
| versionCode                      | All HAP/HSP **versionCode** fields must be the same.|
| debug                            | Since API version 20, the **debug** field values of all HAPs must be the same. If the **debug** field value of HAP is **false**, the **debug** field value of HSP must also be **false**. If the **debug** field value of HAP is **true**, there is no requirement for the **debug** field of HSP.<br>For API version 19 and earlier versions, the **debug** field values of all HAPs/HSPs must be the same.   |
| minAPIVersion                    | Since API version 20, the **minAPIVersion** field values of all HAPs must be the same and be greater than or equal to the maximum value of the **minAPIVersion** field of all HSPs.<br>For API version 19 and earlier versions, the **minAPIVersion** field values of all HAPs/HSPs must be the same.   |
| minCompatibleVersionCode         | Since API version 16, the **minCompatibleVersionCode** field values of all HAPs must be the same and be greater than or equal to the maximum value of the **minCompatibleVersionCode** field of all HSPs.<br>For API version 15 and earlier versions, the **minCompatibleVersionCode** field values of all HAPs/HSPs must be the same.   |
| targetAPIVersion                 | Since API version 16, the **targetAPIVersion** field values of all HAPs must be the same and be greater than or equal to the maximum value of the **targetAPIVersion** field of all HSPs.<br>For API version 15 and earlier versions, the **targetAPIVersion** field values of all HAPs/HSPs must be the same.   |
| versionName                | Since API version 12, the **versionName** field is no longer verified.     |

> **NOTE**
>
> - The **module.json** file is the build product of DevEco Studio. For the mapping between the fields in the **module.json** file and the items in the configuration file, see [Table 1 Mapping between attributes of the module.json file and items of the configuration file](packing-tool.md).

**Compression rules during APP packing:** During APP packing, the HAP and HSP files in release mode are compressed, and the HAP and HSP files in debug mode are not compressed.

> **NOTE**
> 
> If the .so file has been compressed in the HAP/HSP and is compressed again during APP packing, the size of the .so file will not be significantly reduced.

Packing command example:

```
java -jar app_packing_tool.jar --mode app [--hap-path <path>] [--hsp-path <path>] --out-path <path> [--signature-path <path>] [--certificate-path <path>] --pack-info-path <path> [--pack-res-path <path>] [--force true] [--encrypt-path <path>] [--pac-json-path <path>] [--atomic-service-entry-size-limit <size>] [--atomic-service-non-entry-size-limit <size>] [--replace-pack-info false]

| --replace-pack-info    | No    | true or false         | Whether to use the **pack.info** file specified by the **--pack-info-path** parameter to replace the **pack.info** file in the HAP and HSP files during APP packing. The value **true** means to replace, and **false** means the opposite. The default value is **true**.<br>This parameter is supported since API version 22.|



## Multi-project Packing Command

If multiple teams develop the same application but it is inconvenient to share code, you can use multi-project packing, which packs the packed HAP, HSP, and APP files into a final APP file and releases it to the application market.

## HQF Packing Command

If you find detects in the application and want to rectify the defects quickly, you can use HQF files. You can use the JAR package of the packing tool to generate an HQF file for an application by passing in packing options and file paths.

Packing command example:

```
java -jar app_packing_tool.jar --mode hqf --json-path <path> [--lib-path <path>] [--ets-path <path>] [--resources-path <path>] --out-path <path> [--force true]
```

**Table 8** Parameters of the HQF packing command

| --force     | No    | true or false| The default value is **false**. If the value is **true**, an existing target file will be forcibly deleted during unpacking.|

## APPQF Packing Command

An APPQF file consists of one or more HQF files. These HQF files are split from an APPQF file in the application market and then distributed to specific devices. You can use the JAR package of the packing tool to generate an APPQF file for an application by passing in packing options and file paths.

**APPQF Packing Validity Verification**
- When packing an APPQF file, ensure that the values of **versionName**, **versionCode**, **patchVersionName**, and **patchVersionCode** in the [patch.json file](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/ide-incremental-debugging#section28031446182019) of each HQF are the same.
- All HQFs must be unique. An HQF duplication occurs when both of the following conditions are met:
	1. The **name** fields under module in the **patch.json** files of the two HQFs are the same.
	2. The **deviceTypes** attributes under module in the **patch.json** files of the two HQFs intersect (at least one device type is the same).

Packing command example:

```
java -jar app_packing_tool.jar --mode appqf --hqf-list <path> --out-path <path> [--force true]
```

**Table 9** Parameters of the APPQF packing command

| Name        | Mandatory| Option         | Description                                |

| --mode     | Yes    | appqf       | Packing mode.                             |
| --hqf-list | Yes    | NA          | Path of the [HQF file](packing-tool.md#hqf-packing-command). Use commas (,) to separate multiple HQF files.             |
| --out-path | Yes    | NA          | Path of the target file. The file name extension must be .appqf.           |
| --force    | No    | true or false| The default value is **false**. If the value is **true**, an existing target file will be forcibly deleted during unpacking.|

## versionNormalize Command

For the same APP, the values of **versionName** and **versionCode** of all the HAP and HSP files must be the same. When only one HAP or HSP needs to be updated, you can run the **versionNormalize** command to unify the versions of these HAP or HSP files. This command changes the version numbers and names of the HAP and HSP files passed in, and generates in the specified directory new HAP and HSP files with the same names and a **version_record.json** file to record their original version numbers and names.

Packing command example:
```
java -jar app_packing_tool.jar --mode versionNormalize --input-list 1.hap,2.hsp --version-code 1000001 --version-name 1.0.1 --out-path out
```

**Table 10** Parameters of the versionNormalize command

## generalNormalize Command

This command is used to modify the following parameters of the HAP/HSP file: **deviceType**, **bundleName**, **versionName**, **versionCode**, **minCompatibleVersionCode**, **minAPIVersion**, **targetAPIVersion**,<br>
**apiReleaseType**, **bundleTypes**, **installationFree**, and **deliveryWithInstall**. It can also generate a modified HAP/HSP file with the same name and a **general_record.json** file in the specified directory to record the original parameter names and module names of all HAPs/HSPs. The parameters set above must comply with the correct packing specifications. Otherwise, the HAP/HSP file fails to be generated in the specified directory, and no file is generated in the specified directory.

> **NOTE**
>
> - Since API version 20, the **generalNormalize** command is supported.

Packing command example:

```
java -jar app_packing_tool.jar --mode generalNormalize --input-list 1.hsp,2.hsp --bundle-name com.example.myapplication --version-code 1000001 --version-name 1.0.1 --min-compatible-version-code 14 --min-api-version 14 --target-api-version 14 --api-release-type Release1 --bundle-type app --installation-free false --delivery-with-install true --device-types default,tablet --out-path out

## Packing Commands for FastApp Files

You can use the JAR package of the packing tool to generate an APP file for a fast application by passing in packing options and path of the HAP or HSP files. The APP file is used to release the application to the application market.

**Table 14** Validity verification rules for fastApp file packing

| Fields in module.json of HAP/HSP That Are Verified | Verification Rules                          |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **name** field in module               | All HAP/HSP **name** fields must be different.     |
| bundleName                       | All HAP/HSP **bundleName** fields must be the same. |
| bundleType                       | All HAP/HSP **bundleType** fields must be the same. |
| versionCode                      | All HAP/HSP **versionCode** fields must be the same.|
| debug                            | Since API version 20, the **debug** field values of all HAPs must be the same. If the **debug** field value of HAP is **false**, the **debug** field value of HSP must also be **false**. If the **debug** field value of HAP is **true**, there is no requirement for the **debug** field of HSP.<br>For API version 19 and earlier versions, the **debug** field values of all HAPs/HSPs must be the same.   |
| minAPIVersion                    | Since API version 20, the **minAPIVersion** field values of all HAPs must be the same and be greater than or equal to the maximum value of the **minAPIVersion** field of all HSPs.<br>For API version 19 and earlier versions, the **minAPIVersion** field values of all HAPs/HSPs must be the same.   |
| minCompatibleVersionCode         | Since API version 16, the **minCompatibleVersionCode** field values of all HAPs must be the same and be greater than or equal to the maximum value of the **minCompatibleVersionCode** field of all HSPs.<br>For API version 15 and earlier versions, the **minCompatibleVersionCode** field values of all HAPs/HSPs must be the same.   |
| targetAPIVersion                 | Since API version 16, the **targetAPIVersion** field values of all HAPs must be the same and be greater than or equal to the maximum value of the **targetAPIVersion** field of all HSPs.<br>For API version 15 and earlier versions, the **targetAPIVersion** field values of all HAPs/HSPs must be the same.   |

> **NOTE**
>
> - The **module.json** file is the build product of DevEco Studio. For the mapping between the fields in the **module.json** file and the items in the configuration file, see [Table 1 Mapping between attributes of the module.json file and items of the configuration file](packing-tool.md).

**Compression rules**: During APP file packing, the HAP and HSP files in release mode are compressed, while those in debug mode are not.

> **NOTE**
> 
> If the .so file has been compressed in the HAP/HSP and is compressed again during APP packing, the size of the .so file will not be significantly reduced.

### 10016003 Failed to Verify Distribution Policy Intersection
**Error Message**

Check two distroFilter policy disjoint invalid.

**Description**

[The logic for checking HAP uniqueness](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/ide-hvigor-verification-rule) checks whether the distribution policies intersect. However, the distribution policies are incorrectly configured. As a result, the system cannot determine whether the distribution policies intersect.

**Possible Causes**

The **policy** and **value** tags of the distribution policy are empty or invalid.

**Solution**

Check the distribution policy configuration and ensure that the value of **policy** is **include** or **exclude**. For details about the value of **value**, see [distributionFilter](../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md#distributionfilter).

### 10016006 Invalid HAP File
**Error Message**

Verify hap info is invalid.

**Description**

During the APP file building, the HAP or HSP file used for packing fails to be verified.

**Possible Causes**

The configurations of multiple HAP/HSP files conflict with each other.

**Solution**

Check the configuration items in the [app.json5](../quick-start/app-configuration-file.md) and [module.json5](../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md) file based on the error information. If multiple error messages are displayed, check the first error message first.

### 10016007 Invalid Entry Module
**Error Message**

Check entry module invalid.

**Description**

When a project contains multiple HAP files of the entry type during APP file building, the configuration information fails to be checked.

**Possible Causes**

The uniqueness check for the HAP file failed.

**Solution**

### 10016009 Check Dependency Error
**Error Message**

Check dependency list is invalid.

**Description**

During the APP file building, the module dependency check fails.

**Possible Causes**

1. Modules are dependent on each other cyclically. For example, if **dependencies** in **module.json5** of module **library1** is set to **library2** and **dependencies** in module **library2** is set to **library1**, the two modules are dependent on each other cyclically.
2. **type** in **module.json5** of the dependent module in the **module.json5** configuration is **entry** or **feature**.

**Solution**

1. Check **dependencies** in [module.json5](../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md) and delete all cyclic dependencies.
2. Check the **dependencies** configuration in **module.json5** and delete the dependencies on entry or feature modules.

### 10016010 Invalid Atomic Service
**Error Message**

### 10016011 Invalid Atomic Service Preloads
**Error Message**

Atomicservice preloads is invalid.

**Description**

During the building of an APP file whose **bundleType** is **atomicService**, the preloaded modules of the atomic service are invalid.

**Possible Causes**

1. Duplicate **moduleName**s are configured for **preloads** in **module.json5** of the atomic service package.
2. The **moduleName** configured for **preloads** in the atomic service package does not match the **name** in **module.json5** of other atomic service packages.
3. The **moduleName** configured for **preloads** is the same as the **name** in **module.json5** of the atomic service package.

**Solution**

Check the [preloads](../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md#atomicservice) attribute of the atomic service in [module.json5](../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md) to ensure that no duplicate modules are configured, all modules are configured, and the module name of the atomic service package is not configured.

### 10016012 Target Module Does Not Exist
**Error Message**

TargetModuleName is not exist.

**Description**

During the APP file building, the target module is configured in the module, but the module is not found.

**Possible Causes**

**targetModuleName** is configured in **module.json5**, but the value is different from **name** in **module.json5** of other modules.

**Solution**

Check the **targetModuleName** configuration item and ensure that it is correctly configured. For details, see [Tags in the module.json5 Configuration File](../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md#tags-in-the-configuration-file) and the **targetModuleName** attribute. If necessary, create a target module.

### 10016014 The Proxy Data Is Not Unique
**Error Message**

Proxy data uri is not unique.

**Description**

The URI of the data proxy is not unique.

**Possible Causes**

Duplicate URIs are configured for **proxyData** in **module.json5**.

**Solution**

Check [module.json5](../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md) and delete duplicate URIs from **proxyData** to ensure that each URI is unique. For details, see [proxyData](../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md#proxydata).

### 10016015 Invalid ContinueType Configuration
**Error Message**

Check continueType is invalid.

**Description**

The **continueType** configuration is incorrect during APP building.

**Possible Causes**

1. Duplicate **continueType**s are configured for different abilities in the **module.json5** file.
2. Duplicate **deviceType** and **continueType** items are configured for different abilities in the **module.json5** file.

**Solution**

Check [module.json5](../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md) and delete the duplicate configuration items of **continueType** or **deviceType**.

### 10016016 File Size Error
**Error Message**

Check file size failed.

**Description**

During the building of an atomic service app, the size of a single package exceeds the upper limit.

**Possible Causes**

The size of a single package exceeds the upper limit. For details, see the **--atomic-service-entry-size-limit** and **--atomic-service-entry-size-limit** parameters in [**Table 5** Parameters of the APP packing command](#app-packing-command).

**Solution**

Optimize and reduce the size of a single package file, for example, delete unnecessary resources, simplify code, or compress files.

### 10016018 Failed to Check the Atomic Service Module Size
**Error Message**

Check the atomicService module size failed.

**Description**

During the building of an atomic service app, the size of a single package and its dependent shared library exceeds the upper limit.

**Possible Causes**

The total size of the single package and its dependent shared library exceeds the upper limit. For details, see the **--atomic-service-entry-size-limit** and **--atomic-service-entry-size-limit** parameters in [**Table 5** Parameters of the APP packing command](#app-packing-command).

**Solution**

Optimize and reduce the package size, for example, delete unnecessary resources, simplify code, or reduce dependencies.

### 10016019 Invalid Distribution Policy
**Error Message**

Check the entry module distributionFilter is invalid.

**Description**

The distribution policy of the entry module is incorrect.

**Possible Causes**

The distribution policy of the entry module is incorrect.

**Solution**

Check whether the distribution policy of the entry module is correctly configured. For example, the value of **policy** should be **exclude** or **include**. For details, see [distributionFilter](../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md#distributionfilter).

### 10011021 Failed to Run the generalNormalize Command

**Error Message**
