The SDK provides various tools for you to develop apps, such as viewing logs, installing apps, and starting tests.


## Obtaining Command Line Tools

- Obtain the tools from the SDK. The SDK is embedded in [DevEco Studio](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/ide-software-install) and does not need to be downloaded or configured separately. The SDK is stored in the sdk directory under the DevEco Studio installation directory.

- Obtain the tools from the sdk folder in [Command Line Tools](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/ide-commandline-get).

To obtain the tools of the latest version, update DevEco Studio or Command Line Tools.

> **NOTE**
>
> The storage locations of the command line tools are different. For details, see the document of each tool.
