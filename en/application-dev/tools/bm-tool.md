## Description

### userId

ID of the current system account. For details about the APIs related to system accounts, see [@ohos.account.osAccount (System Account Management)](../reference/apis-basic-services-kit/js-apis-osAccount.md). The following lists several common system accounts.

- **userId = 100**: System account with ID 100. This is the default system account, which is created by the system account management module when the device is started for the first time after delivery. After the account is created, all pre-installed bundles are installed for ID 100.

- **userId = 102**: System account with ID 102. This account is created by the system account management module. <!--Del-->You can create an account using the [createOsAccountForDomain](../reference/apis-basic-services-kit/js-apis-osAccount-sys.md) API. <!--DelEnd-->Only system bundles can create accounts. Bundles installed for account 100 are not displayed for account 102. If necessary, reinstall the bundles for account 102. When account 102 is created, the system installs the pre-installed system bundles for account 102.

- **userId = 0**: Shared system account, also called account 0. Unlike the system account, the shared system account is not created by the system account management module. Bundles installed for account 0 are shared by all system accounts and are displayed for each system account. All third-party bundles cannot be installed for account 0.

### 9568344 The Configuration File Fails to Be Parsed
**Error Message**

error: install parse profile prop check error.

![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001585361412.png)

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or run an application, the error message "error: install parse profile prop check error" is displayed during the installation of the HAP.

**Possible Causes**

1. The **bundleName** in the [app.json5 configuration file](../quick-start/app-configuration-file.md#tags-in-the-configuration-file) and **name** in the [module.json5 configuration file](../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md#tags-in-the-configuration-file) are invalid.

<!--Del-->
2. The **type** field in [extensionAbilities](../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md#extensionabilities) is set to **service** or **dataShare**.
<!--DelEnd-->


**Solution**
1. Modify the **bundleName** field in the app.json5 configuration file and the **name** field in the module.json5 file based on the naming rule.
<!--Del-->
2. If the **type** field in **extensionAbilities** is set to **service** or **dataShare**, set [allowAppUsePrivilegeExtension](../../device-dev/subsystems/subsys-app-privilege-config-guide.md) for the bundle as follows:

    1. Obtain the new signature fingerprint.

        a. In the project-level **build-profile.json5** file (in the root directory of the project), obtain the value of **profile** in the **signingConfigs** field, which is the storage path of the signature file.

        b. Open the signature file (with the file name extension .p7b), search for **development-certificate** in the file, copy **-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----**, **-----END CERTIFICATE-----**, and the information between them to a new text file, delete the newline characters, and save the file as a new .cer file.

        The format of the new .cer file is shown below. (The file content is an example.)

        ![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001585521364.png)

        c. Use the keytool (available in the **jbr/bin** folder of the DevEco Studio installation directory) to obtain the SHA-256 value of the certificate fingerprint from the .cer file:
          ```
          keytool -printcert -file xxx.cer
          ```
        d. Remove the colon from the SHA-256 content in the certificate fingerprint. What you get is the signature fingerprint.

        The following figure shows an example.

        ![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001635921233.png)

        After colons are removed, the obtained signature fingerprint is **5753DDBC1A8EF88A62058A9FC4B6AFAFC1C5D8D1A1B86FB3532739B625F8F3DB**.

    2. Obtain the **install_list_capability.json** file of the device.

        a. Connect to the device and enter the shell.
        ```
        hdc shell
        ```
        b. Run the following command to view the **install_list_capability.json** file of the device:
        ```
        // Locate the file on the device.
        find /system -name install_list_capability.json
        ```
        c. Run the following command to obtain the **install_list_capability.json** file:
        ```
        hdc target mount
        hdc file recv /system/etc/app/install_list_capability.json
        ```

    3. Add the signature fingerprint obtained to **app_signature** in the **install_list_capability.json** file. Note that the signature fingerprint must be configured under the corresponding bundle name.
    ![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001635641893.png)
    4. Push the modified **install_list_capability.json** file to the device and restart the device.

        ```
        hdc target mount
        hdc file send install_list_capability.json /system/etc/app/install_list_capability.json
        hdc shell chmod 644 /system/etc/app/install_list_capability.json
        hdc shell reboot
        ```
    5. Reinstall the bundle.<!--DelEnd-->

**Symptom**

During bundle update, the singleton configuration in the **app.json5** file of the existing HAP file is inconsistent with that of the update package. (The singleton configuration is deprecated since API version 9.)

**Possible Causes**

The singleton configuration in the **app.json5** file of the existing HAP file is inconsistent with that of the update package. (The singleton configuration is deprecated since API version 9.)

**Solution**

Solution 1: Uninstall the existing bundle package and install a new one.

Solution 2: Change the singleton configuration in the update package to be the same as that in the existing package, repack and update the bundle package.<!--DelEnd-->

<!--Del-->
### 9568294 Installation Failure Due to Inconsistent Bundle Types
**Error Message**

error: install failed due to apptype not same.

**Symptom**

The [app-feature](../security/app-provision-structure.md) configuration in the existing HAP's signature does not match that of the new HAP, causing the installation failure.

**Possible Causes**

The name of the existing HAP is the same as that of the new HAP, but the **app-feature** configuration in the signature file is different.

**Solution**

* Solution 1: Uninstall the existing HAP and install the new HAP.
* Solution 2: Change the **app-feature** field in the new HAP's signature file to match that of the existing HAP. Then, repack and [sign the bundle or atomic service](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/ide-signing), and install the HAP again.<!--DelEnd-->

### 9568297 Installation Failed Due to an Earlier SDK Version
**Error Message**

error: install failed due to older sdk version in the device.

![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001635521909.png)

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or run an application, the error message "error: install failed due to older sdk version in the device" is displayed during the installation of the HAP.

**Possible Causes**

The SDK version used for build and packing does not match the device image version.

**Solution**

* Scenario 1: The device image version is earlier than the SDK version for build and packing. Update the device image version. Run the following command to query the device image version:
  ```
  hdc shell param get const.ohos.apiversion
  ```
  If the API version provided by the image is 10 and the SDK version used for bundle build is also 10, the possible cause is that the image version is too early to be compatible with the SDK verification rules of the new version. In this case, update the image version to the latest version.

* Scenario 2: For bundles that need to run on OpenHarmony devices, ensure that runtimeOS has been changed to OpenHarmony.


### 9568300 Installation Failed Due to Duplicate Bundle Module Names
**Error Message**

error: moduleName is not unique.

**Symptom**

During the installation of a multi-module bundle, duplicate module names cause the uniqueness check to fail, so installation is aborted.

**Possible Causes**

During the installation of a multi-module bundle, a module name conflict occurs.

**Solution**

Check the name in the **module.json5** file of each module and ensure that the names are different. Then, pack the bundle again and install it.



### 9568332 Installation Fails Due to Inconsistent Signatures
**Error Message**

error: install sign info inconsistent.

![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001635761329.png)

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or run an application, the error message "error: install sign info inconsistent" is displayed during the installation of the HAP.

**Possible Causes**

1. The signatures of the existing bundle and new bundle are different, or the signatures of HAPs and HSPs are different. (If the [keys](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/ide-signing#section462703710326) or <!--RP7-->**app-identifier**s in the bundle [profiles](../security/app-provision-structure.md)<!--RP7End--> of two bundles are the same, their signatures are the same.) However, **Keep Bundle Data** (the bundle installation is overwritten) is selected in **Edit Configurations** of DevEco Studio and the bundle is re-signed.
2. If a bundle is uninstalled but its data is kept, and a new bundle with the same bundle name is later installed, it is necessary to check whether the signature details match. This error is reported if the values of [key](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/ide-signing#section462703710326) in the signature information and <!--RP7-->the values of **app-identifier** in the [profiles](../security/app-provision-structure.md)<!--RP7End--> of the bundles are different.


**Solution**

1. Uninstall the bundle, or deselect **Keep Bundle Data**. Then install the new bundle.
2. If the signature inconsistency is caused by HSPs provided by different teams, use [integrated HSP](../quick-start/integrated-hsp.md). If there are multiple HAPs, ensure that their signatures are the same.
3. If a bundle is uninstalled but its data is kept, a new bundle with the same bundle name but different signature information fails to be installed. To install the new bundle, you must first reinstall the uninstalled bundle and uninstall it without retaining the data.

### 9568329 The Signature Information Fails to Be Verified
**Error Message**

error: verify signature failed.

![Example](figures/en_image_155401.png)

**Symptom**

The **bundleName** in the signature information is different from that of the bundle.

**Possible Causes**

* Scenario 1: An HSP module provided by a third party is imported, and the HSP is neither an [integrated HSP](../quick-start/integrated-hsp.md) nor an HSP with the same bundle name, causing the bundle name inconsistency.

* Scenario 2: An incorrect signature file (with the file name extension .p7b) is used for signature, causing the bundle name inconsistency.


**Solution**

* Scenario 1: Use an HSP only for the bundle with the same bundle name; use an integrated HSP for bundles with different bundle names. Ask the third party to provide an integrated HSP or an HSP with the same bundle name.

* Scenario 2: Check the signing process and signing certificate. For details, see [Configuring a Debug Signature](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides/ide-signing).


### 9568266 Installation Permission Denied

**Solution**

1. Run the **hdc install** command to install and debug the enterprise bundle with a debug signature.


### 9568337 Installation Parsing Fails
**Error Message**

error: install parse unexpected.

**Symptom**

When a bundle is pushed to a device, an error message is displayed, indicating that the HAP file fails to be opened.

**Possible Causes**

* Scenario 1: When you run the **hdc file send** command, files on the device are damaged due to insufficient storage space.

* Scenario 2: The HAP file is damaged when it is pushed to the device.

**Solution**

* Scenario 1: Check the device storage usage. If the storage space is insufficient, free it up.
<!--RP4-->
  ```bash
  hdc shell df -h /system
  ```
<!--RP4End-->

* 2. Check the MD5 values of the local HAP file and the HAP file pushed to the device. If they are different, the HAP is damaged during the push. In this case, push the file again.

## FAQs

### 1. The pre-installed system bundle has been uninstalled. When the new bundle is installed, an error message is displayed, indicating that the bundle is downgraded or the signature information is inconsistent. What should I do?

**Symptom**

When a new bundle is installed after the existing bundle is uninstalled, an error message is displayed indicating that the bundle is downgraded or the signature information is inconsistent. However, the corresponding bundle icon is displayed on the home screen and can be started properly.

**Possible Causes**

The security control capability is enhanced for pre-installed bundles that have been uninstalled. When an application with the same bundle name is installed, the system restores the bundle in the pre-installed image version and then installs the new bundle.

**Solution**

Rectify the fault based on the error information and error code.
