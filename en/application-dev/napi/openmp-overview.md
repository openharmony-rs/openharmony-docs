[Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP)](https://www.openmp.org/) provides a set of APIs that support multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming. It consists of a set of compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables that influence runtime behavior. It provides high-level abstract description of parallel algorithms, making it suitable for developing parallel applications on multi-core processor devices. Based on the **pragma** directives added to the application, the compiler automatically processes the application segments in parallel. Using OpenMP can reduce the complexity of parallel programming.

## When to Use

OpenMP has been widely used in scientific computing, image processing, machine learning, financial computing, bioinformatics and other high-performance computing fields. It is particularly suitable for computing-intensive tasks and addressing data parallelism issues. By simplifying the development process of multi-core parallelization, OpenMP helps efficiently utilize the multi-core resources of modern processors and addresses traditional parallel programming challenges, such as complex thread management, uneven task loads, and performance bottlenecks. With the flexible scheduling mechanism and cross-platform support of OpenMP, applications can significantly enhance performance while maintaining code simplicity and portability. OpenMP is a crucial tool for improving both the development and computing efficiency.

## Version Description

Currently, the OpenHarmony uses the OpenMP library provided by [llvm 15.0.4](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-15.0.4). For details about the OpenMP API version, see [clang-OpenMPSupport](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/OpenMPSupport.html).

For details about how to use OpenMP in OpenHarmony applications, see [Building and Running Applications with OpenMP](openmp-guideline.md).
