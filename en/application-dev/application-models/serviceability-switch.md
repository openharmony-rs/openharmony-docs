The ServiceAbility component in the [FA model](ability-terminology.md#fa-model) corresponds to the ServiceExtensionAbility component in the [stage model](ability-terminology.md#stage-model). The ServiceExtensionAbility class provides system APIs. Only system applications can create ServiceExtensionAbility instances. Therefore, ServiceAbility switching adopts different policies for system applications and third-party applications.  


## Switching a ServiceAbility for a System Application

The procedure for switching a ServiceAbility for a system application is similar to the procedure of PageAbility switching.

1. [Create a ServiceExtensionAbility](serviceextensionability-sys.md) in the stage model.

2. Migrate the ServiceAbility code to the ServiceExtensionAbility.

The table below describes the lifecycle comparison of the ServiceAbility and ServiceExtensionAbility.

| ServiceAbility| ServiceExtensionAbility| Comparison Description|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| onStart(): void | onCreate(want: Want): void | The two methods have the same invoking time. In the stage model, the **want** parameter is added so that you can obtain parameters during creation.|
| onCommand(want: Want, startId: number): void | onRequest(want: Want, startId: number): void | The two methods have the same meaning, invoking time, and parameters.|
| onConnect(want: Want): rpc.RemoteObject | onConnect(want: Want): rpc.RemoteObject | The two methods have the same meaning, invoking time, and parameters.|
| onDisconnect(want: Want): void | onDisconnect(want: Want): void | The two methods have the same meaning, invoking time, and parameters.|
| onReconnect(want: Want): void| onReconnect(want: Want): void| The two methods have the same meaning, invoking time, and parameters.|
| onStop(): void | onDestroy(): void | The two methods have the same meaning, invoking time, and parameters.|


## Switching a ServiceAbility for a Third-Party Application

In the stage model, third-party applications cannot provide services for other third-party applications. You can select a switching solution based on your service requirements.

| Service Type| Switching Solution|
| -------- | -------- |
| Providing services for other third-party applications| Match a scenario-specific [ExtensionAbility](extensionability-overview.md).| 
| In-application: providing public use when it is running in the foreground| Extract the component code as a common module for other components to use.| 
| In-application: continuing running when it switches to the background| Switch the service to a [background service](serviceextensionability-sys.md).|
