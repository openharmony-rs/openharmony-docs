The configuration file contains information about the application's configuration, components, and permissions, as well as custom information. The information will be provided for the compiler, application market, and operating system in the build, distribution, and running phases.

The application project code developed based on the [FA model](ability-terminology.md#fa-model) contains a **config.json** file. For details about common configuration items, see [Application- or Component-Level Configuration](application-component-configuration-fa.md). For details about the file, see [Application Configuration File Overview (FA Model)](../quick-start/application-configuration-file-overview-fa.md).
