The [FA model](ability-terminology.md#fa-model) is supported by API version 8 and earlier versions, and the [stage model](ability-terminology.md#stage-model) is recommended since API version 9. The FA model and stage model have their respective components. The FA model provides three types of application components: PageAbility, ServiceAbility, and DataAbility. The stage model provides two types of application components: UIAbility and ExtensionAbility.


You cannot use both models for the development of an application (see the figure below). However, a device (system) can contain applications developed on different models (scenario 3 in the figure below). In this case, their components may interact with each other.

The following table lists the possible interaction scenarios and the concerns of each scenario.

**Table 1** Application component interaction scenarios

| Interaction Scenario| Concerns| 
| -------- | -------- |
| [Starting a UIAbility from the FA Model](start-uiability-from-fa.md)| Set **bundleName** and **abilityName** in the **want** parameter to the bundle name and ability name of the UIAbility in the stage model.| 
| [Connecting to a ServiceExtensionAbility from the FA Model](bind-serviceextensionability-from-fa.md)| Set **bundleName** and **abilityName** in the **want** parameter to the bundle name and ability name of the ServiceExtensionAbility in the stage model.| 
| [Accessing a DataShareExtensionAbility from the FA Model](access-datashareextensionability-from-fa.md)| No code modification is required. However, you need to understand the API compatibility of **DataShareHelper** and **DataAbilityHelper**.| 
| [Starting a PageAbility from the Stage Model](start-pageability-from-stage.md)| Set **bundleName** and **abilityName** in the **want** parameter to the bundle name and ability name of the PageAbility in the FA model.| 
| [Connecting to a ServiceAbility from the Stage Model](bind-serviceability-from-stage.md)| Set **bundleName** and **abilityName** in the **want** parameter to the bundle name and ability name of the ServiceAbility in the FA model.| 
| Accessing a DataAbility from the Stage Model| This type of access is not supported.|
