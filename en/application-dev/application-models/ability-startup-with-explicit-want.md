When a user touches a button in an application, the application often needs to start a UIAbility component to complete a specific task. If the **abilityName** and **bundleName** parameters are specified when starting a UIAbility, then the explicit Want is used.

The user touches a button in the application to start the UIAbility component to complete a specific task. To start the UIAbility component in explicit Want mode, the **abilityName** and **bundleName** parameters must be specified. For details, see [Starting UIAbility in the Same Application](uiability-intra-device-interaction.md#starting-uiability-in-the-same-application).
