The application configuration file contains information about the application's configuration, components, and permissions, as well as custom information. The information will be provided for the compiler, application market, and operating system in the build, distribution, and running phases.

The application project code developed based on the [stage model](ability-terminology.md#stage-model) contains one **app.json5** file and one or more **module.json5** files. For details about common configuration items, see [Application- or Component-Level Configuration (Stage Model)](application-component-configuration-stage.md). For details about the two files, see [Application Configuration File Overview (Stage Model)](../quick-start/application-configuration-file-overview-stage.md).
