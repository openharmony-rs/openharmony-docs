Multimodal Awareness Kit allows an application to identify user activities (walking, running, driving, etc.) or postures based on the data collected by sensors including gyroscopes and acceleration sensors built in a HarmonyOS device.

## How Multimodal Awareness Kit Works

Multimodal Awareness Kit is offered by the system as a basic service for applications. Depending on the service scenario, an application needs to initiate a subscription request to the system and cancel the subscription when the service scenario ends. In this process, the system reports the device status information to the application on a real-time basis.

## Constraints

To use Multimodal Awareness Kit, you need to apply for required permissions. The device must support the sensors required by the corresponding capabilities.
