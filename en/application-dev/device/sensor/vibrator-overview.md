# Vibrator Overview


The **vibrator** module extends the vibrator service via maximizing utilization of vibrator hardware capabilities. By innovatively integrating vibration and interaction, the module takes user interaction efficiency and usability to the next level.


## Working Principles

The vibrator is a Misc device that consists of four modules: Vibrator API, Vibrator Framework, Vibrator Service, and HDF layer.

- Vibrator API: provides basic vibrator APIs, including the APIs for obtaining the vibrator list, querying the vibrator by effect, and triggering and stopping vibration.

- Vibrator Framework: manages the framework layer of the vibrator and communicates with the Misc Device Service.

- Misc device service: manages services of controllers.

- HDF layer: adapts to different devices.


## Constraints

When using a vibrator, you must declare the **ohos.permission.VIBRATE** permission before you can control the vibration effect.
