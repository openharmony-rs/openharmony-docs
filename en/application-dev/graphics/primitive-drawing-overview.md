No matter how complex a graphic is, it is composed of basic primitives. Canvas provides various primitive drawing functions to meet the drawing requirements of basic primitives. This section describes how to draw geometric shapes (such as points, circles, and rectangles), images, and text blocks, and provides sample code for you to implement the required UI effects.


Drawing primitives is the last step. Before drawing primitives, you need to create a canvas and set the required drawing effects.
