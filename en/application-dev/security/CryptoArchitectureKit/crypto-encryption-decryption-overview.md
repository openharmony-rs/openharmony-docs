# Encryption and Decryption Overview

Important data needs to be encrypted in data storage or transmission for security purposes.

Typical encryption and decryption operations involve the following:

1. Encrypt and decrypt data using a symmetric key.

2. Encrypt and decrypt data using an asymmetric key pair.

3. Obtain and set the **CipherSpecItem** parameter when RSA is used with the PKCS1_OAEP padding mode.
