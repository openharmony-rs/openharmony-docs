## Introduction
Bluetooth is a wireless communication technology that enables short-range data transmission. Its technical specifications are developed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). can be used to connect a variety of devices, including smartphones, headsets, speakers, keyboards, mouse devices, and printers. Currently, Bluetooth has two common technical categories: Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

Bluetooth is a short-range communication protocol based on radio technologies. It uses radio waves in the 2.4 GHz band for communication and uses the Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) to prevent interference with other wireless devices. During the communication process, the Bluetooth device sends and receives data packets, and uses different Bluetooth profiles to control the communication process and data transmission.

## Bluetooth Classic
Bluetooth Classic is also known as Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR). Bluetooth EDR is an enhanced version of Bluetooth BR technology, featuring a higher data transmission rateâ€”2 to 3 times faster than BR, with a maximum speed of 2 to 3 Mbit/s. Under ideal conditions, its communication range is approximately 100 meters.

Bluetooth Classic offers diverse and mature technical profiles. Examples include profiles for advanced audio distribution, hands-free calling, personal area network (PAN), and phonebook access. Leveraging these profiles, Bluetooth Classic can meet diverse needs across various application scenarios. For instance, it enables listening to music via Bluetooth headsets, speakers, and other devices; accessing data such as phonebooks and text messages from smartphones through car systems; and realizing data sharing between devices.

## Bluetooth Low Energy
BLE is a technology supported starting from Bluetooth 4.0. Compared with Bluetooth Classic, BLE features lower power consumption while ensuring a certain transmission rate, making it widely used in Bluetooth devices with high requirements for battery life. Its maximum transmission rate can reach 1 Mbit/s, and its communication range is usually around 10 meters.

Compared with Bluetooth Classic, BLE, with its low power consumption feature, is widely applied in fields such as wearable devices, smart homes, and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors.
