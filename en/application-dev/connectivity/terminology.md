# Connectivity Kit Terminology
## A
### A2DP
Advanced Audio Distribution Profile. This protocol is used to support transmission of high-quality audio, for example, listening to music with a Bluetooth headset.
### ACL
Asynchronous connectionless link. It is used to indicate the connection status of physical links between devices in the Bluetooth subsystem.
## B
### BLE
Bluetooth Low Energy. This protocol is supported since Bluetooth 4.0. Compared with traditional Bluetooth, BLE features low power consumption and long battery life.
### BR
Basic Rate. It is a Bluetooth wireless communication technology representing traditional Bluetooth, which is mainly used in scenarios such as file and audio stream transmission.
### Bluetooth SIG
Bluetooth Special Interest Group, an organization that releases Bluetooth technical specifications. Developers can obtain detailed Bluetooth technical documentation from their official website.
## C
### Characteristic
Core data unit of a GATT service. It supports data read/write and is uniquely identified by a UUID.
## D
### Descriptor
Data unit of a GATT characteristic, which describes the characteristic's additional information and attributes. It supports read/write operations and is uniquely identified by a UUID.
## E
### EDR
Enhanced Data Rate. It is an enhanced version of BR that offers a higher data transmission rate. Together with BR, they are collectively referred to as traditional Bluetooth.
## G
### GATT
Generic Attribute Profile. It is the core protocol of BLE that defines the mechanism for Bluetooth communication and data transmission based on services, characteristics, and descriptors.
## H
### HFP
Hand Free Profile. This protocol is used to enable hands-free calling between Bluetooth devices, supporting bidirectional voice calls and control functions.
### HID
Human Interface Device Profile, which is specifically designed for Bluetooth Classic. This protocol enables low-latency bidirectional communication between Bluetooth-enabled human-computer interaction devices, such as transmitting data between keyboards, mice, and gamepads, and hosts like mobile phones, tablets, and PCs.
### HOGP
HID over GATT Profile, which is an HID specification implemented based on the GATT protocol of BLE. It ports traditional HID functions to BLE devices for reuse and is compatible with the HID interaction logic of BLE devices such as keyboards, mice, and selfie sticks.
## M
### MAP
Message Access Profile. This protocol can be used to synchronize data such as SMS and emails between Bluetooth devices.
### MTU
Maximum transmission unit. It indicates the maximum size of a single data packet transmitted on the network, in bytes.
## P
### PAN
Personal Area Network. This protocol supports network sharing between devices.
### PBAP
Phone Book Access Profile. This protocol can be used to synchronize phone book data such as contacts and call logs between Bluetooth devices.
### Profile
Bluetooth technology protocol or capability in the Bluetooth subsystem, for example, A2DP, HFP, or HID.
## R
### RSSI
Received signal strength indicator. It is used in wireless communications to quantify the signal strength at the receiver in dBm.
## S
### Service
Service in the GATT protocol. It is a data structure containing multiple characteristics and dependent services. It represents a capability of a BLE device and is uniquely identified by a UUID.
### SPP
Serial Port Profile. This protocol can be used to implement connection and data transmission between Bluetooth devices.
## U
### UUID
Universally Unique Identifier, which is a 128-bit string. It is used to identify different profiles, as well as services, characteristics, and descriptors in the GATT protocol.
