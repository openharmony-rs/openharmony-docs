## A
### A2DP
Advanced Audio Distribution Profile, which is used to support transmission of high-quality audio, for example, listening to music with a Bluetooth headset.
### ACL
Asynchronous connectionless link, which is used to indicate the connection status of physical links between devices in the Bluetooth subsystem.
## B
### BLE
Bluetooth Low Energy, which is supported since Bluetooth 4.0. Compared with traditional Bluetooth, BLE features low power consumption and long battery life.
### BR
Basic Rate, which is a Bluetooth wireless communication technology representing Bluetooth Classic. It is mainly used in scenarios such as file and audio stream transmission.
### Bluetooth SIG
Bluetooth Special Interest Group, which is an organization that releases Bluetooth technical specifications. Developers can obtain detailed Bluetooth technical documentation from their official website.
## C
### Characteristic
Core data unit of the GATT service, which supports read/write operations and is uniquely identified by a UUID.
## D
### Descriptor
Data unit of a GATT characteristic, which describes the characteristic's additional information and attributes. It supports read/write operations and is uniquely identified by a UUID.
## E
### EDR
Enhanced Data Rate, which enhances BR by offering a higher data transmission rate. Together with BR, they are collectively referred to as traditional Bluetooth.
## G
### GATT
Generic Attribute Profile, which is the core protocol of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) that defines the mechanism for Bluetooth communication and data transmission based on services, characteristics, and descriptors.
## H
### HFP
Hand Free Profile, which is used to enable hands-free calling between Bluetooth devices, supporting bidirectional voice calls and control functions.
### HID
Human Interface Device Profile, which enables low-latency bidirectional communication between Bluetooth-enabled human-computer interaction devices, such as transmitting data between keyboards, mouse devices, and gamepads, and hosts like mobile phones, tablets, and PCs. It is specifically designed for Bluetooth Classic.
### HOGP
HID over GATT Profile, which is an HID specification implemented based on the GATT protocol of BLE. It ports traditional HID functions to BLE devices for reuse and is compatible with the HID interaction logic of BLE devices such as keyboards, mouse devices, and selfie sticks.
## M
### MAP
Message Access Profile, which can be used to synchronize data such as SMS and emails between Bluetooth devices.
### MTU
Maximum transmission unit, which indicates the maximum size of a single data packet transmitted on the network, in bytes.
## O
### OPP
Object Push Profile, which is built on the Generic Object Exchange Profile (GOEP) to transmit data (such as images and documents) between devices.
## P
### PAN
Personal Area Network, which implements network sharing between devices.
### PBAP
Phone Book Access Profile, which can be used to synchronize phone book data such as contacts and call logs between Bluetooth devices.
### Profile
Bluetooth technology protocol or capability in the Bluetooth subsystem, for example, A2DP, HFP, or HID.
## R
### RSSI
Received signal strength indicator. It is used in wireless communications to quantify the signal strength at the receiver in dBm.
## S
### Service
Bluetooth GATT service, which is a data structure containing multiple characteristics and dependent services. It represents a capability of a BLE device and is uniquely identified by a UUID.
### SPP
Serial Port Profile, which can be used to implement connection and data transmission between Bluetooth devices.
## U
### UUID
Universally Unique Identifier, which is a 128-bit string that identifies different Bluetooth profiles, as well as services, characteristics, and descriptors in the GATT protocol.
