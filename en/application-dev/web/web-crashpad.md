The **Web** component supports process crash information collection using Crashpad. Crashpad is a process crash information handling tool provided by the Chromium kernel. When a process (including the main process and web rendering process) crashes due to the use of a **Web** component, Crashpad writes the **minidump** file in the sandbox directory of the main process of the application. This file is in binary format and the filename extension is **.dmp**. It records crash causes, thread information, and register information. You can use this file to analyze process crashes related to **Web** components.

How to use

1. When a process crashes because a **Web** component is used in the application, the corresponding **dmp** file is generated in the sandbox directory of the main process of the application. The sandbox path is as follows:

   ```c
   /data/storage/el2/log/crashpad
   ```

2. Access the DMP file of the application sandbox by referring to [Accessing Files on the Native Side](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/best-practices/bpta-file-native-side).

3. Parse the DMP file as follows:

   * Use the minidump_stackwalk tool to parse the DMP file, and then you can obtain the process crash information (crash cause, thread information, and register information). The example is as follows (Linux environment):

     ```c
     ./minidump_stackwalk b678e0b5-894b-4794-9ab3-fb5d6dda06a3.dmp > parsed_stacktrace.txt
     ```

     You can obtain minidump_stackwalk by compiling the source code of breakpad project. For details, see [Breakpad](https://chromium.googlesource.com/breakpad/breakpad).

   * Sample of the parsed file is as follows:

     ```c
     Crash reason:  SIGSEGV /SEGV_MAPERR    The signal that causes the process crash, which is a segment error.
     Crash address: 0x0
     Process uptime: 12 seconds

     Thread 0 (crashed)                     The Thread 0 crashes.
      0 libweb_engine.so + 0x2e0b340        Call stack of layer 0. 0x2e0b340 is the offset address of the .so file, which can be used to decompile and parse the crash source code (depending on the unstripped .so file).

   * Use the llvm toolchain to parse the crash source code. The example is as follows (Linux environment):

     ```c
     ./llvm-addr2line -Cfpie libweb_engine.so 0x2e0b340
     ```

     The llvm-addr2line toolchain can be obtained in the SDK.
