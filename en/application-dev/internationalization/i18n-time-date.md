# Date and Time Formatting

## Use Cases

The date and time formats vary according to countries and cultures. The difference lies in such aspects as the sequence of year, month, and day in a date and the separator of hour, minute, and second in the time. If your application needs to display the date and time, ensure that the information is displayed in line with local user habits for easy understanding.

Time and date formatting includes date and time formatting, relative time formatting, and time segment formatting. Date and time formatting means to convert the date and time into a string in the specified format. Relative time formatting means to convert the time difference between a time point and another time point to the specified format, for example, 30 seconds ago or 1 day later. Time segment formatting means to convert a time segment to the specified format, for example, Wednesday or 8:00-11:30.
