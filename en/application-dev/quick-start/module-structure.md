Application icons cannot be hidden from the home screen:

The system strictly controls applications without icons to prevent malicious applications from deliberately configuring no icon to block uninstall attempts.

Setting the application icon to be displayed on the home screen:<br>Set **icon**, **label**, and **skills** under **abilities** in the **config.json** file. Make sure the **skills** configuration contains **action.system.home** and **entity.system.home**.
```
{
  "module":{

    // ...

    "abilities": [{
      "icon": "$media:icon",
      "label": "Login",
      "skills": [{
        "actions": ["action.system.home"],
        "entities": ["entity.system.home"],
        "uris": []
      }]
    }],

    // ...

  }
}
```

To hide an entry icon on the home screen, you must configure the **AllowAppDesktopIconHide** privilege.<!--Del--> For details, see [Application Privilege Configuration Guide](../../device-dev/subsystems/subsys-app-privilege-config-guide.md).<!--DelEnd--> The rules for displaying the entry icon and entry label are as follows:
* The HAP file contains Page ability configuration.
  * The application icon on the home screen is set under **abilities** in the **config.json** file.
    * The application does not have the privilege to hide its icon from the home screen.
      * The system uses the icon configured for the Page ability as the entry icon and displays it on the home screen. Touching this icon will direct the user to the home page of the Page ability.
      * The system uses the label configured for the PageAbility as the entry label and displays it on the home screen. If no label is configured, the bundle name is returned.
    * The application has the privilege to hide its icon from the home screen.
      * The application information is not returned when the home screen queries the information, and the entry icon and label of the application are not displayed on the home screen.
  * The application icon on the home screen is not set under **abilities** in the **config.json** file.
    * The application does not have the privilege to hide its icon from the home screen.
      * The system uses the default icon as the entry icon and displays it on the home screen. Touching this icon will direct the user to the application details screen under application management, as shown in Figure 1.
      * The system uses the bundle name of the application as the entry label and displays it on the home screen.
    * The application has the privilege to hide its icon from the home screen.
      * The application information is not returned when the home screen queries the information, and the entry icon and label of the application are not displayed on the home screen.
* The HAP file does not contain Page ability configuration.
  * The application does not have the privilege to hide its icon from the home screen.
    * The system uses the default icon as the entry icon and displays it on the home screen. Touching this icon will direct the user to the application details screen under application management, as shown in Figure 1.
    * The system uses the bundle name of the application as the entry label and displays it on the home screen.
  * The application has the privilege to hide its icon from the home screen.
    * The application information is not returned when the home screen queries the information, and the entry icon and label of the application are not displayed on the home screen.

**Figure 1** Application details screen

![Application details screen](figures/application_details.jpg)

**NOTE**<br>The label displayed on the application details screen may be different from the one displayed on the home screen. These two are the same if the entry icon and label are configured for the non-Page ability.<br>
