## deviceTypes

  **Table 2** deviceTypes
<!--RP2-->
| Device Type| Value| Description|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |

<!--RP2End-->

Example of the **deviceTypes** structure:


```json
{
  "module": {

```


## pages

The **pages** tag is a profile that represents information about specified pages.


```json
{
  "module": {
    // ...
    "pages": "$profile:main_pages", // Configured through the resource file in the profile

}
```

Define the **main_pages.json** file under **resources/base/profile** in the development view. The file name (**main_pages** in this example) can be customized, but must be consistent with the information specified by the **pages** tag. The file lists the page information of the current application, including the route information and the window-related configuration.

```json
{
  "src": [
    "pages/index/mainPage",
    "pages/second/payment",
    "pages/third/shopping_cart",

  ],
  "window": {
    "designWidth": 720,
    "autoDesignWidth": false
  }

      "readPermission": "",
      "writePermission": "",
      "exported": true,
      "uri":"scheme://authority/path/query",
      "skills": [{
        "actions": [],
        "entities": [],
        "uris": [],
        "permissions": []
      }],
      "metadata": [

}
```

## shortcuts

The **shortcuts** tag provides the shortcut information of an application. The value is an array and consists of four sub-attributes: **shortcutId**, **label**, **icon**, and **wants**.

The **shortcut** information is specified in **metadata**, where:

- **name** indicates the name of the shortcut, identified by **ohos.ability.shortcuts**.

- **resource** indicates where the resources of the shortcut are stored.

**Table 10** Shortcuts

| Name| Description| Data Type | Initial Value Allowed|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| shortcutId | ID of the shortcut. The value is a string with a maximum of 63 bytes. **This field cannot be configured using the resource index ($string).**| String| No|
| label | Label of the shortcut, that is, the text description displayed for the shortcut. The value is a string with a maximum of 255 bytes. It can be descriptive content or a resource index.| String| Yes (initial value: left empty)|
| icon | Icon of the shortcut. The value is the index of the icon resource file.| String| Yes (initial value: left empty)|
| visible | Whether the shortcut is visible. The value **true** indicates that the shortcut is visible; **false** indicates the opposite.<br>**NOTE**<br>This field is supported since API version 20.<br>| Boolean| Yes (initial value: **true**)|
| [wants](#wants) | Wants to which the shortcut points. If the **startShortcut** API of **launcherBundleManager** is called, the first target component in the wants is started. As such, you are advised to configure only one element for **wants**.| Object| Yes (initial value: left empty)|


1. Configure the **shortcuts_config.json** file in **/resources/base/profile/**.

   ```json
   {
     "shortcuts": [
       {
         "shortcutId": "id_test1",
         "label": "$string:shortcut",
         "icon": "$media:aa_icon",
         "visible": true,
         "wants": [
           {
             "bundleName": "com.ohos.hello",
             "moduleName": "entry",
             "abilityName": "EntryAbility",
             "parameters": {
               "testKey": "testValue"
             }
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. In the **abilities** tag of the **module.json5** file, configure the **metadata** tag for the UIAbility component to which a shortcut needs to be added so that the shortcut configuration file takes effect for the UIAbility.

   ```json
   {
     "module": {
       // ...
       "abilities": [
         {
           "name": "EntryAbility",
           "srcEntry": "./ets/entryability/EntryAbility.ets",
           // ...
           "skills": [
             {
               "entities": [
                 "entity.system.home"
               ],
               "actions": [
                 "ohos.want.action.home"
               ]
             }
           ],
           "metadata": [
             {
               "name": "ohos.ability.shortcuts",
               "resource": "$profile:shortcuts_config"
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```
### wants

The **wants** tag provides wants information for a shortcut.

**Table 11** wants

| Name| Description| Data Type | Initial Value Allowed|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| bundleName | Target bundle name of the shortcut.| String| No|
| moduleName | Target module name of the shortcut.| String| Yes|
| abilityName| Target ability name of the shortcut.| String| No|
| parameters | Custom data when the shortcut is started. The data must be strings. A key can contain a maximum of 1024 characters.| Object| Yes|

Example of the **data** structure:

```json
{
  "wants": [
    {
      "bundleName": "com.ohos.hello",
      "moduleName": "entry",
      "abilityName": "EntryAbility",
      "parameters": {
        "testKey": "testValue"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## distributionFilter

The **distributionFilter** tag defines the rules for distributing HAP files based on different device specifications, so that precise matching can be performed when the application market distributes applications.

> **NOTE**
> This tag is supported since API version 10. In earlier versions, the **distroFilter** tag is used.

- **Application scenario**: If a project has multiple entry-type modules and the values of **deviceType** configured for these modules overlap, you need to use this tag to distinguish the modules. In the following example, both entry-type modules support the tablet type, and therefore the **distributionFilter** tag is required.
  ```json
  // Device types supported by entry1
  {
    "module": {
      "name": "entry1",
      "type": "entry",
      "deviceTypes" : [
        "tv",
        "tablet"
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
  ```json
  // Device types supported by entry2
  {
    "module": {
      "name": "entry2",
      "type": "entry",
      "deviceTypes" : [
        "car",
        "tablet"
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

- **Configuration rule**: This tag consists of four attributes, including [screenShape](#screenshape), [screenWindow](#screenwindow), [screenDensity](#screendensity), and [countryCode](#countrycode). For details, see the following table.

  During distribution, a unique HAP is determined based on the mapping between **deviceTypes** and the preceding attributes.

  * When configuring this tag, include at least one of the attributes.
  * If any one or more attributes are set for one entry-type module, the same attributes must be set for all other entry-type modules.
  * The **screenShape** and **screenWindow** attributes are available only for lite wearables.
