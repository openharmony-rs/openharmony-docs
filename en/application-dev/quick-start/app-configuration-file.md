## appEnvironments

The **appEnvironments** tag represents the application environment variables. Running applications tend to depend on some third-party libraries that use custom environment variables. To avoid modifying the implementation logic of the third-party libraries, you can customize environment variables in the project configuration file for use during runtime.

**Table 2** appEnvironments

| Name| Description| Data Type| Initial Value Allowed|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| name          | Name of the environment variable. The value is a string with a maximum of 4096 bytes.| String | Yes (initial value: left empty)|
| value         | Value of the environment variable. The value is a string with a maximum of 4096 bytes.      | String | Yes (initial value: left empty)|

Example of the **appEnvironments** structure:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "appEnvironments": [
      {
        "name":"name1",
        "value": "value1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## multiAppMode

The **multiAppMode** tag represents the multi-app mode of the application.

**Table 3** multiAppMode

| Name| Description| Data Type| Initial Value Allowed|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| multiAppModeType          | Multi-open mode. The options are as follows:<br>- **multiInstance**: multi-instance mode. Only 2-in-1 devices are supported. A resident process does not support this value.<br>- **appClone**: app clone mode.| String | No|
| maxCount         | Maximum number of applications that can be opened. The options are as follows:<br>- In **multiInstance** mode, the value ranges from 1 to 10.<br>- In **appClone** mode, the value ranges from 1 to 5.     | Number | No|

Example of the **multiAppMode** structure:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "multiAppMode": {
      "multiAppModeType": "appClone",
      "maxCount": 5
    }
  }
}
```

## configuration

This tag corresponds to a profile resource, which is used to configure whether the font size of an application changes with the system.

Example of the **configuration** structure:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "configuration": "$profile:configuration"  
  }
}
```

Define the **configuration.json** file under **AppScope/resources/base/profile** in the development view. The file name (**configuration** in this example) can be customized, but must be consistent with the file specified by the **configuration** tag. The configuration file lists the attributes that enable the application font size to change with the system.

**Table 4** configuration

| Name| Description| Data Type| Initial Value Allowed|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| fontSizeScale | Settings of the application font size. The options are as follows:<br>- **followSystem**: The font size follows the system.<br>- **nonFollowSystem**: The font size does not follow the system.| String| Yes (initial value: **nonFollowSystem**)|
| fontSizeMaxScale | Maximum ratio of the application font size after the font size is set to follow the system. The options are as follows: **1**, **1.15**, **1.3**, **1.45**, **1.75**, **2**, and **3.2**.	 <br> For example, the value is set to **1.75** and the system font size is 10 fp, the application font size changes as follows:<br>(1) If the system font size is set to 1.5 times its original size in Settings, the application font size also changes to 15 fp, in line with the system.<br>(2) If the system font size is set to 2 times its original size in Settings, the system font size is 20 fp. However, the application font size is 17.5 fp because the maximum ratio of the application font size is set to 1.75.<br>**NOTE**<br>If **fontSizeScale** is set to **nonFollowSystem**, this attribute does not take effect. | String| Yes (initial value: **3.2**)|

Example of the **configuration** structure:

```json
{
  "configuration": {
    "fontSizeScale": "followSystem",
    "fontSizeMaxScale": "3.2"
  }
}
```
