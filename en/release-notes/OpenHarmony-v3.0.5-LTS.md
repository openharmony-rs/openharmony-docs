## Source Code Acquisition


### Prerequisites

1. Register your account with Gitee.

2. Register an SSH public key for access to Gitee.

3. Install the [git client](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [git-lfs](https://gitee.com/vcs-all-in-one/git-lfs?_from=gitee_search#downloading), and configure user information.
   
   ```
   git config --global user.name "yourname"
   git config --global user.email "your-email-address"
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```

4. Run the following commands to install the **repo** tool:
   
   ```
   curl -s https://gitee.com/oschina/repo/raw/fork_flow/repo-py3 > /usr/local/bin/repo  # If you do not have the permission, download the tool to another directory and configure it as an environment variable by running the chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/repo command.
   pip3 install -i https://repo.huaweicloud.com/repository/pypi/simple requests
   ```


### Acquiring Source Code Using the repo Tool

**Method 1 (recommended)**: Use the **repo** tool to download the source code over SSH. (You must have an SSH public key for access to Gitee.)


```
repo init -u git@gitee.com:openharmony/manifest.git -b refs/tags/OpenHarmony-v3.0.5-LTS --no-repo-verify
repo sync -c
repo forall -c 'git lfs pull'
```

**Method 2**: Use the **repo** tool to download the source code over HTTPS.


```
repo init -u https://gitee.com/openharmony/manifest.git -b refs/tags/OpenHarmony-v3.0.5-LTS --no-repo-verify
repo sync -c
repo forall -c 'git lfs pull'
```
