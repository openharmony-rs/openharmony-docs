## Source Code Acquisition


### Prerequisites

1. Register your account with Gitee.

2. Register an SSH public key for access to Gitee.

3. Install the [git client](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [git-lfs](https://gitee.com/vcs-all-in-one/git-lfs?_from=gitee_search#downloading), and configure user information.
   ```
   git config --global user.name "yourname"
   git config --global user.email "your-email-address"
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```

4. Run the following commands to install the **repo** tool:
   ```
   curl -s https://gitee.com/oschina/repo/raw/fork_flow/repo-py3 > /usr/local/bin/repo # If you do not have the permission, download the tool to another directory and configure it as an environment variable by running the chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/repo command.
   pip3 install -i https://repo.huaweicloud.com/repository/pypi/simple requests
   ```


### Acquiring Source Code Using the repo Tool

**Method 1 (recommended)**

Use the **repo** tool to download the source code over SSH. (You must have an SSH public key for access to Gitee.)

- Obtain the source code from the version branch. You can obtain the latest source code of the version branch, which includes the code that has been incorporated into the branch up until the time you run the following commands:
   ```
   repo init -u git@gitee.com:openharmony/manifest.git -b OpenHarmony-5.0.2-Release --no-repo-verify
   repo sync -c
   repo forall -c 'git lfs pull'
   ```
   
- Obtain the source code from the version tag, which is the same as that released with the version.
   ```
   repo init -u git@gitee.com:openharmony/manifest.git -b refs/tags/OpenHarmony-v5.0.2-Release --no-repo-verify
   repo sync -c
   repo forall -c 'git lfs pull'
   ```

**Method 2**

Use the **repo** tool to download the source code over HTTPS.

- Obtain the source code from the version branch. You can obtain the latest source code of the version branch, which includes the code that has been incorporated into the branch up until the time you run the following commands:
   ```
   repo init -u https://gitee.com/openharmony/manifest -b OpenHarmony-5.0.2-Release --no-repo-verify
   repo sync -c
   repo forall -c 'git lfs pull'
   ```
   
- Obtain the source code from the version tag, which is the same as that released with the version.
   ```
   repo init -u https://gitee.com/openharmony/manifest -b refs/tags/OpenHarmony-v5.0.2-Release --no-repo-verify
   repo sync -c
   repo forall -c 'git lfs pull'
   ```
